Rick Santorum to Student Activists: Don’t March, Learn CPR|The day after hundreds of thousands of students and their supporters marched across the country and the world to advocate action on gun violence, Rick Santorum told CNN that they might as well give up now. “How about kids instead of looking to someone else to solve their problem, do something about maybe taking CPR classes or trying to deal with situations that when there is a violent shooter that you can actually respond to that?” the former Republican senator suggested on State of the Union. He went on to dismiss the “action” taken by the student activists who survived a mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, last month as little more than asking someone else to pass a law. “They didn’t take action to say, ‘How do I, as an individual, deal with this problem? How am I going to do something about stopping bullying within my own community? What am I going to do to actually help respond to a shooter?’” Santorum said. “Those are the kind of things where you can take it internally, and say, ‘Here’s how I’m going to deal with this. Here’s how I’m going to help the situation,’ instead of going and protesting and saying, ‘Oh, someone else needs to pass a law to protect me.’” But as CNN’s Van Jones pointed out, it is ultimately up to lawmakers, not students, to pass laws to protect them. Speaking of his own teenage son, he said, “If his main way to survive high school is learning CPR so when his friends get shot—that to me, we’ve gone too far. I’m proud of these kids. I know you're proud of these kids too.” Santorum responded by saying he is “proud” of the students, but in the next breath criticized them for believing “some phony gun law” is going to prevent the next school shooting. “Phony gun laws don’t solve these problems,” he said. More than using the march to try to convince lawmakers to change their views, the student activists have said the main goal is to encourage voters to show up at the polls for the midterm elections this fall.
Jehovah's Witnesses accused of silencing victims of child abuse|More than 100 people have contacted the Guardian with allegations of child sexual abuse and other mistreatment in Jehovah’s Witness communities across the UK. Former and current members, including 41 alleged victims of child sexual abuse, described a culture of cover-ups and lies, with senior members of the organisation, known as elders, discouraging victims from coming forward for fear of bringing “reproach on Jehovah” and being exiled from the congregation and their families. A Guardian investigation also heard from 48 people who experienced other forms of abuse, including physical violence when they were children, and 35 who witnessed or heard about others who were victims of child grooming and abuse. The stories told to the Guardian ranged from events decades ago to more recent, and many of those who came forward have now contacted the police. They told the Guardian about: An organisation that polices itself and teaches members to avoid interaction with outside authorities. A rule set by the main governing body of the religion that means for child sexual abuse to be taken seriously there must be two witnesses to it. Alleged child sex abuse victims claiming they were forced to recount allegations in front of their abuser. Young girls who engage in sexual activity before marriage being forced to describe it in detail in front of male elders. A solicitor representing some of the alleged victims said she believed there were thousands of complainants in the UK and that the people who have contacted the Guardian were “just the tip of the iceberg”. One alleged victim, Rachel Evans, who has waived her right to anonymity, claimed there was a paedophile ring active in the 1970s, although details of the case cannot be divulged due to a current investigation. “Within the Jehovah’s Witnesses there is an actual silencing and also a network where if someone went to the elders and said ‘there is a problem with this’ and they believe you, the whole thing will be dealt with in-house. But often these people are not dealt with, they are either moved to another congregation or told to keep their head down for a few years,” she said. Another victim, who did not want to be named, said she was abused by a ministerial servant (someone with congregational responsibilities) in the organisation in the 1970s.
US Army veteran who served two tours in Afghanistan has been deported to Mexico|A US Army veteran who served two tours in Afghanistan has been deported to Mexico, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement said. The deportation follows an earlier decision by US authorities to deny Miguel Perez's citizenship application because of a felony drug conviction, despite his service and the PTSD he says it caused. Perez, 39, was escorted across the US-Mexico border from Texas and handed over to Mexican authorities Friday, ICE said in a statement. Perez said via phone during a Monday press conference that he is currently in Tijuana. "We're going to hold ICE responsible if anything happens to Miguel Perez Jr.," said Emma Lozano, pastor at Lincoln United Methodist Church in Chicago, where Perez lived. It is a sanctuary church, or a place that promises to provide shelter and support for undocumented immigrants. Perez, his family and supporters, who include Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, had argued that his wartime service to the country had earned him the right to stay in the United States and to receive mental health treatment for the PTSD and substance abuse. "This case is a tragic example of what can happen when national immigration policies are based more in hate than on logic and ICE doesn't feel accountable to anyone," Duckworth said in a statement following reports of Perez's deportation. "At the very least, Miguel should have been able to exhaust all of his legal options before being rushed out of the country under a shroud of secrecy." Perez was born in Mexico and legally came to the United States at age 8 when his father, Miguel Perez Sr., a semi-pro soccer player, moved the family to Chicago because of a job offer, Perez told CNN earlier. He has two children born in the United States. His parents and one sister are now naturalized American citizens, and another sister is an American citizen by birth. It's a complicated case. Perez has said that what he saw and experienced in Afghanistan sent his life off the rails, leading to heavy drinking, a drug addiction and ultimately to his felony conviction. "After the second tour, there was more alcohol and that was also when I tried some drugs," Perez said last month. "But the addiction really started after I got back to Chicago, when I got back home, because I did not feel very sociable." In 2010, he was convicted in Cook County, Illinois, on charges related to delivering more than 2 pounds of cocaine to an undercover officer. He was sentenced to 15 years and his green card was revoked. He had served half his sentence when ICE began deportation proceedings. He had been in the agency's custody since 2016. Perez has said he was surprised to be in ICE detention and mistakenly believed that enlisting in the Army would automatically give him US citizenship, according to his lawyer, Chris Bergin. His retroactive application for citizenship was denied earlier this month. While there are provisions for expediting troops' naturalization process, a main requirement is that the applicant demonstrate "good moral character," and the drug conviction was enough to sway the decision against his application, Bergin said. Perez enlisted in the Army in 2001, just months before 9/11. He served in Afghanistan from October 2002 to April 2003 and again from May to October 2003, according to his lawyer. He left the Army in 2004 with a general discharge after he was caught smoking marijuana on base. Perez went on a hunger strike earlier this year, saying he feared deportation would mean death. Aside from not getting the treatment he needs, he told CNN that he fears Mexican drug cartels will try to recruit him because of his combat experience and will murder him if he doesn't cooperate. "If they are sentencing me to a certain death, and I am going to die, then why die in a place that I have not considered my home in a long time?" he asked.
Man sucker punches 5-year-old in face on New York City subway: cops|Police are hunting for a man who approached a 5-year-old boy riding the New York City subway and punched him in the face as the child’s mother was standing next to him. The man, identified as Ramon Thomas, 25, was on the G train just before 4:30 p.m. Saturday when he attacked the boy who was standing next to his mother, police said. The train was approaching the Bergen Street station in Brooklyn’s Cobble Hill neighborhood. The man then taunted the child before fleeing the train when the doors opened at the station. It’s unclear what provoked the attack. Police sources told the New York Daily News the attacker yelled at the boy, “Are you going to cry to ya’ mommy?” The boy suffered bruising and swelling to the left side of his face. He was taken to the hospital, treated for his injuries and later released. Police shared photos that a witness snapped of the alleged attacker. Thomas was described as being 6 feet tall, 180 pounds with brown eyes and black hair. 
The Mormon Church Must Learn from #MeToo|In recent months, our country has been having a critical and long overdue national conversation on sexual harassment and abuse. From Hollywood power brokers to celebrity chefs to members of the news media, we are seeing a new era of transparency and accountability as victims step forward and speak out. But as a lifelong Mormon and father of six girls, it was the case of former top Trump White House official Rob Porter that struck closest to home. In speaking out about years of alleged abuse by Porter, his two ex-wives began to shed a long overdue light on the unique, deeply personal, and some would say, disturbing, role that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints can sometimes play in the lives of its members. In Porter’s case, we learned that two young women had turned to their church leaders for guidance in the face of abuse and instead were encouraged by church bishops to stay in an allegedly abusive marriage. In short, to stay quiet and place the professional career of their husband ahead of their own well-being. For those Americans not members of the LDS Church, they may not be aware that Mormon bishops are different from priests or rabbis in that this is a part-time position occupied by older male congregants and who often have little formal training in counseling or pastoral work. Yet, they hold tremendous influence in the lives of their fellow church members, particularly women and children. Many Americans would be startled to learn that the stories of these two young women and Mormon bishops are not only not unique, but there are many that are much worse. The Porter case, the #MeToo movement and the broader national conversation our country is having today on abuse and harassment has laid bare the reality that practices that may have been accepted years ago should no longer tolerated today. Today, the LDS Church stands alone among the major religions as not just allowing, but in fact encouraging, private one-on-one interactions between children and older male church members, without the presence of their parents. Imagine being a 12-year-old girl, and being called into a small room with an older man, whom you trust because he is a leader in your church. He says he’s going to ask you some questions that will determine how “worthy” you are in the eyes of God. The intrusive questions often are of a sexual nature. Your parents are not allowed to be present.
Congress gives police in other countries easier access to U.S. data, raising privacy concerns|Police in other countries will be able to get emails and other electronic communication more easily from their own citizens and from Americans under a bill that Congress stuffed inside the massive $1.3 trillion spending deal passed last week. Supporters said the bill, dubbed the CLOUD Act, will simplify the process for the U.S. government and its allies to get evidence of serious crimes and terrorist threats when that evidence is stored on a server in another country.Internet providers had been able to legally stop police agencies from gaining access to their own citizens' emails if those emails were stored in a foreign nation. Microsoft stores data on about 1 million servers in 40 countries. "The CLOUD Act can save lives, preserve international relations, empower law enforcement and ensure justice for citizens," said James Scott, senior fellow at the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology. Opponents, including civil liberty and privacy rights groups, said the law could make it easier for nations with human rights abuses to spy on dissidents and collect data on Americans who communicate with foreign nationals.
Daylight Saving Time Could Soon Be Year-Round in Florida|Florida just wants to protect its sunshine. Florida Gov. Rick Scott signed off on legislation Friday that would make daylight saving time in the Sunshine State year-round. The move would lengthen the amount of sunny hours in the winter and no longer require Floridans to set their clocks back an hour in the fall — and, as a result, move them forward in the spring. Scott said observing daylight saving time year round would mean people in Florida could “enjoy everything our beautiful state has to offer later in the day,” according to the Associated Press. The implementation of the legislation, however, would only happen if approved by Congress on the federal level, the bill says. Since the federal government determines the nation’s time zones, it also controls the start of daylight saving time and the return to standard time, Florida included. No states have independently been able to observe daylight saving time year round. But states like Hawaii and parts of Arizona, as well as U.S. territories like Puerto Rico and Guam, have opted not to observe daylight saving time since those areas get sunshine year-round. In Arizona, for example, not engaging in daylight saving time means that waking hours can be less hot for residents. Other states like Maine and Massachusetts have explored trying to permanently move their clocks forward year-round. With the dark evening hours of the winter, residents in those states have said they use more electricity. The darker hours also can impact those with depression and seasonal affective disorder.
Americans less likely to trust Facebook than rivals on personal data|Opinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany cast doubt over the level of trust people have in Facebook over privacy, as the firm ran advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers apologizing to users. Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag, Germany’s largest-selling Sunday paper, found 60 percent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy. Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized for “a breach of trust” in advertisements placed in papers including the Observer in Britain and the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal. “We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can’t, we don’t deserve it,” said the advertisement, which appeared in plain text on a white background with a tiny Facebook logo. The world’s largest social media network is coming under growing government scrutiny in Europe and the United States, and is trying to repair its reputation among users, advertisers, lawmakers and investors. This follows allegations that the British consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to users’ information to build profiles of American voters that were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016. U.S. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press” on Sunday that Facebook had not been “fully forthcoming” over how Cambridge Analytica had used Facebook data. Warner repeated calls for Zuckerberg to testify in person before U.S. lawmakers, saying Facebook and other internet companies had been reluctant to confront “the dark underbelly of social media” and how it can be manipulated.
Iranian hackers attacked college professors, US agencies and companies: Justice Department|Nine Iranians were charged Friday by the Justice Department in a wide-ranging scheme to hack and steal electronic data from universities, private corporations and U.S. government entities to benefit the government of Iran. The Iranians were indicted on seven counts accusing them of identity theft and conspiracy to commit computer intrusions. The nine allegedly accessed the computer systems of U.S. universities through duplicitous electronic contacts, a scheme known as phishing. They targeted more than 100,000 professor email accounts at 144 American universities through the spearphishing campaign, the indictment said. The activity, which had allegedly been conducted since 2013, could cost universities $3.4 billion. "That type of criminal activity does not just cause economic harm," Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said. "It also threatens our national security. Identifying and prosecuting computer hackers is a priority for the Department of Justice." The nine defendants were accused of being affiliated with the so-called Mabna Institute and acted at the behest of one of Iran's intelligence gathering entities.They also targeted and compromised at least 36 U.S.-based private companies and at least 11 companies based in Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, proescutors said. And the indictment counts at least five government agencies, including the Labor Department, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the United Nations, among the victims of the hacking campaign. The nine are at large, the Justice Department said. In addition to the hacks on U.S. entities, accounts from 176 universities outside the U.S. were targeted, authorities said. The data breaches successfully compromised roughly 7,998 accounts or more worldwide, and at least 3,768 belonged to professors at U.S. universities, investigators said. "Academic institutions are prime targets for foreign cybercriminals. Universities can thrive as marketplaces of ideas and engines of research and development only if their work is protected from theft," Rosenstein said. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control issued sanctions against the Iranians on Friday. Rosenstein announced the indictments alongside several senior officials — including David Bowdich, who succeeded Andrew McCabe as the FBI's acting deputy director following McCabe's firing last week.
Huawei dealt a blow, loses Best Buy as retail partner|It's going to get harder for Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei to sell its smartphones in the US. Best Buy, the nation's largest electronics retailer, has ceased ordering new smartphones from Huawei and will stop selling its products over the next few weeks, according to a person familiar with the situation. The retailer will also stop selling its laptops and smartwatches. Best Buy made the decision to end the relationship, the person said. The retailer didn't provide any additional details. "We don't comment on specific contracts with vendors, and we make decisions to change what we sell for a variety of reasons," said a Best Buy spokeswoman. A Huawei spokeswoman called Best Buy a valued partner. But "as a policy, we do not discuss the details of our partner relationships," she said. The move is a critical blow to Huawei, which is the world's third-largest smartphone vendor behind Apple and Samsung but has struggled to establish any presence in the US. Best Buy was one of Huawei's biggest retail partners, and one of the rare places you could see its unlocked smartphones, laptops and smartwatches in person. Huawei's Android-powered phones aren't sold by any US carriers, which is how a majority of Americans typically buy their phones. Global Data analyst Avi Greengart called it "devastating for Huawei." Huawei was widely expected to announce a partnership with AT&T in January at CES to carry the Mate 10 Pro smartphone, but the carrier reportedly backed out because of political pressure. A few days later, Verizon reportedly nixed its own plans to sell Huawei phones. Instead, Richard Yu, CEO of the company's consumer business, spent his time talking about the phones, which were already in the market elsewhere, as well as touting the Porsche Design variant of the smartphone.
