Scientists Believe They Found a Way to Stop Future Hurricanes in Their Tracks|There have been at least a dozen devastating hurricanes that have wreaked havoc in the last decade – but there may be hope on the horizon for a solution. These Norwegian scientists believe that they may be able to use existing technologies to stop hurricanes in their tracks. Hurricanes are only able to form when the temperature of the ocean’s surface reaches 26.5° Celsius (79.7º Fahrenheit). If humans could cool off the temperature of the sea whenever a hurricane was brewing, they could theoretically stop the storm from forming. “Climate change is causing sea surface temperatures to increase”, says Grim Eidnes, the senior research scientist at SINTEF Ocean. “The critical temperature threshold at which evaporation is sufficient to promote the development of hurricanes is 26.5°C. In the case of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico in the period August to September 2017, sea surface temperatures were measured at 32°C.” While there have been a few creative ideas on how to cool down ocean temperatures – such as towing Arctic glaciers into tropical waters – the researchers at SINTEF want to use technology native to their home country. SINTEF, which is the largest independent research organization in Scandinavia, published an article this week about how we could use “bubble curtains” to prevent storms from forming. A bubble curtain is a flurry of air bubbles that are released from pipes planted in the ocean. If planted in tropical waters, the bubbles would be released in deeper waters so that by the time they reached the surface, they would be cold enough to sufficiently lower the temperature of the shallower waters. “Our initial investigations show that the pipes must be located at between 100 and 150 meters depth in order to extract water that is cold enough” says Eidnes. “By bringing this water to the surface using the bubble curtains, the surface temperature will fall to below 26.5°C, thus cutting off the hurricane’s energy supply.” “This method will allow us quite simply to prevent hurricanes from achieving life-threatening intensities,” he added. For years, Norway has been using bubble curtains to prevent ice from forming in their fjords – and SINTEF researchers believe that bubble curtains will work the exact same way for hurricanes. “During Norwegian winters, sea surface water is colder than at depth, so by lifting warmer water to the surface using bubble curtains, we can prevent the fjords from icing up”, he says. Last spring, the bubble curtain project was granted funding from Innovation Norway in order to carry out preliminary studies. The researchers now hope that if the studies prove successful, they can be successfully implemented in high-risk areas of the ocean.
The scary truth about what’s hurting our kids|In the past week, I’ve read several studies that are scary to me… it’s the scary truth about what’s hurting our kids.   We all know that what our kids hear becomes their inner voice, but it’s hard to control what they hear from others, isn’t it? CNN recently interviewed Dr. Jean Twenge, author of iGen and her interview worried me – because I saw the truth that I would be facing in just a few short years.   Dr. Twenge started doing research 25 years ago on generational differences, but when 2011 -2012 hit, she saw something that would scare her to the core.   This is the year when those having iPhones went over the 50% mark. The results of that should scare all of us. This was the year that more kids started to say that they felt “sad, hopeless, useless… that they couldn’t do anything right (depression).” They felt left-out and lonely. There is a 50% increase in a clinical level depression between 2011-2015. A substantial increase in suicide rate.Before I give you any more, I want you to look at these graphs and look at how the information correlates to the iPhones being released. They aren’t hanging out with friends nearly as much. They aren’t dating as much. More likely to feel lonely. They are getting less sleep. She goes on to say that we are in the worst mental health crisis in decades.   You can get her book, iGen, with my Amazon affiliate link here, to read the rest of her findings. Why is this happening?  Why are kids more depressed because of electronics? Think about when we were in school – we didn’t know every time that there was a get-together that we weren’t invited to and we didn’t see pictures of each outing, game, or party. We didn’t care what we looked like when we were hanging out with friends, because we were  the only ones that were there- I can remember sitting around with my best friends in our sweatpants, just laughing – I didn’t wear makeup or care if I had my hair fixed just right, because the worry of a phone or camera wasn’t there. Think about bullies.  When we left the school, we left them.   If teasing happened, it didn’t happen at home.  It didn’t happen so publicly.   Everyone couldn’t see it or know what they were teasing other kids about since they weren’t there.  Now, it’s all public knowledge, and anyone can join in or watch.   It’s horrifying. I can’t imagine being a tween or teenager now.   Although- as the parents of children, we have to believe it, because we have to help our children navigate it. According to Victoria Prooday, Occupational Therapist & writer at YourOT.com, “There is a silent tragedy developing right now, in our homes, and it concerns our most precious jewels – our children… Researchers have been releasing alarming statistics on a sharp and steady increase in kids’ mental illness, which is now reaching epidemic proportions:  1 in 5 children has mental health problems,  43% increase in ADHD, 37% increase in teen depression, 200% increase in suicide rate in kids 10-14 years old“ She goes on to say that “Today’s children are being deprived of the fundamentals of a ealthy childhood: Emotionally available parents Clearly defined limits and guidance Responsibilities Balanced nutrition and adequate sleep Movement and outdoors Creative play, social interaction, opportunities for unstructured times and boredom Instead, children are being served with: Digitally distracted parents Indulgent parents who let kids “Rule the world” Sense of entitlement rather than responsibility Inadequate sleep and unbalanced nutrition Sedentary indoor lifestyle Endless stimulation, technological babysitters, instant gratification, and absence of dull moments” How true… and how sad. 
Why I won't be quitting Facebook|For a few years now, I’ve been on a quest to lead a “minimalist” life. Inspired by the Japanese organisational expert, Marie Kondo, I began chucking out garbage bags full of excess “stuff” – handbags, shoes, unused sporting equipment and other assorted detritus collected over nearly four decades inhabiting this earth. But what began as a simple spring clean, has had surprising and far reaching effects on my life, spreading far out beyond the top of my wardrobe. At work, I’m throwing overboard extracurricular commitments that distract me from my central cause: helping you, dear Fairfax newspaper reader, make sense of the world around you, particularly anything with a dollar sign in front of it. Minimalism has also had spill over effects on my body. I’ve begun to make more conscious decisions about the quality – and more importantly quantity - of food I put in my body. I’ve also begun paying more conscious attention to the way I choose to spend my precious time, prioritising exercise over other activities, like watching TV. As a result, I’ve lost about 13 kilos in the last year and a half. And this week I ran 7 kilometres continuously for the first time in my life. In my friendships, and other relationships, I’ve become more acutely aware of the impact other people have on me. I’ve been forced to make some difficult and painful decisions about who I choose to spend the most time with. As the famous minimalist maxim goes: “You can’t change the people around you, but you can change the people around you.” Because more so than at any other time in our human history, an unexamined life – an unintentional life - is a miserable one. To go with the flow today is to suffer a host of problems: weight gain, sleep loss, constant anxiety, overconsumption and overcommitment. That’s the way the world is designed these days: to get you to consume more, do more. For most of human history, we’ve battled the central problem of scarcity. The need to secure sufficient resources - of food, shelter and income - to survive. But today, we lead lives – well, most of us in the developed world, anyway – of dazzling abundance, enjoying opportunities for consumption and pleasure that our ancestors could never have dreamed of. In this brave new world, to fail to plan is to plan to fail. The most recent step in my minimalist journey has been attempting to minimise my digital and social media life. I’ve deleted Twitter and Facebook from my smartphone – and reinstalled them – more times than I can count. And this summer, I finally embraced  Instagram. Despite this week’s revelations of a widespread data breach by Cambridge Analytics, I won’t be joining the #DeleteFacebook movement. Because the truth is, I get enormous value out of such platforms. Twitter is an essential tool of modern journalism, enabling us to get up-to-the-second updates on unfolding events. Facebook, too, allows me to keep up to date with a wider social circle than ever before. Put simply, I like knowing who has had their baby, been on a trip and kicked a goal at work. I know it’s a glamorised version of everyone’s life, as is my own Facebook page. And I’m under no illusion that Facebook, as a half a trillion dollar business, is anything other than a platform for advertisers to sell more stuff to me based on the information I provide about myself. I don’t want to alarm you, but newspapers have been serving the very same purpose for centuries now. Only newspapers have been able to glean limited information about their readers, like income and location. The genius of Facebook is to get us to trade our personal information for the utility of using its platform. Yes, Facebook is trying to sell us stuff, but there’s nothing new about that – only the intensely targeted nature of it. And for someone who generally hates shopping, there can be benefit in that too. I’ve clicked on Facebook ads and connected with online sellers whose products I truly value. I’m also guilty of clicking on articles suggested to me by the Facebook algorithm. And sometimes – gasp – I enjoy them too. But we do, each of us, urgently need to do a stocktake of how we use our social media accounts. While such platforms open up a previously unimaginable cornucopia of information and connection, too much of a good thing can quickly turn bad. Unlike those unused golf clubs, it’s not as easy to drop Facebook and other social media platforms altogether. And why would we, when they continue to provide value? But we do need to reassess how we use them. My own personal rule is not to post any information I wouldn’t expect to be printed in a public obituary. If you’re scared about people getting your data, don’t give it to them. And this week I created a new folder on my phone titled “Not good for me” into which I’ve dragged Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and a few other social media apps.It’s my own little reminder that while such apps might be fun, for a bit, they shouldn’t ultimately control us. Only in the real world, with real people and leading lives of purpose and intentionality, can we truly be happy.
What Life Was Like 50 Years Ago Compared to Now|Getting cash required a trip to the bank. Although Barclays introduced the world's first automated teller machine in London in 1967, ATMs didn't make their way across the big pond until 1969. There were no R-Rated Movies. Or any other rated films, in fact. The voluntary Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rating system replaced the all-or-nothing Motion Picture Production Code on Nov. 1, 1968 with G, M, R, and X designations. The Beatles were still a band. The group released their White Album and their movie, Yellow Submarine, in November 1968. Humans hadn't walked on the moon. In 1968, the Apollo program's second manned spacecraft orbited the moon and safely returned on Dec. 28—seven months before Apollo 11's actual moon landing. There was no MLK Jr. Day. Congressman John Conyers Jr. introduced legislation to create the holiday shortly after Dr. King's assassination on April 4, 1968, but it took 15 years and a petition signed by more than 3 million people to make it a reality. President Ronald Reagan signed the bill into law in 1983 and it was first observed on Jan. 15, 1986. Housing discrimination was rampant. President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1968, also called the Fair Housing Act, on April 11, 1968, just seven days after King's assassination. The law prohibits discrimination based on race, gender, religion, or national origin when renting or selling a home. Couples married much earlier in life. In 1968, the median age of first marriage was 20 for women and 23 for men. Back then, close to 70 percent of American adults were married; today only 51 percent are, according to a Pew Research Center study from 2011. The modern bride is 26.5 years old on average and the groom 28.7. Secret Service didn't protect presidential candidates. After presidential hopeful Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated on the campaign trail on June 5, 1968, Congress passed legislation calling for Secret Service protection for major presidential candidates. The drinking age was 18. It became 21 when Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act on July 17, 1984. Interracial romance wasn't for TV. William Shatner and Nichelle Nichols broke that barrier with a kiss on Nov. 2, 1968 in the Star Trek episode "Plato's Stepchildren." Before it aired, NBC censors reportedly expressed concern that Southern TV affiliates would refuse to run it. Seatbelts weren't mandatory. The first federal seatbelt law, requiring all new cars to have a belt for each seat, took effect in1968, but it would be decades before the first state law that required wearing one—that happened in New York on December 1, 1984. A gallon of gas cost 34 cents. That's the equivalent of $2.31 today when adjusted for inflation—very comparable to today's national average of $2.48 a gallon. Air travel was for the privileged. The 1969 debut of the Boeing 747, which could hold double the number of passengers as its predecessor, the 707, led to a dramatic drop in flight prices. 9-1-1 didn't exist. A single, nationwide phone number for emergency assistance was established in1968 following a meeting between the FCC and AT&T. The digits 9-1-1 were chosen because they had never before been used as an area code or other service code. Lead-based paint was all the rage. Widely used in homes and schools, the hazardous substance wasn't banned until 1978, which is why the CDC recommends that children and pregnant women stay away from any homes built before then that are undergoing renovation. Cars weren't equipped with airbags. The automated safety devices were invented in 1968 and developed to deploy on impact, inflating with nitrogen gas. Heart transplants weren't an option. Although South African cardiac surgeon Christiaan Barnard completed the first successful heart transplant in 1967, the first adult heart transplant in the U.S. took place at the Stanford University Hospital in 1968. Of the roughly 100 heart transplants worldwide that year, only a third were successful beyond three months. Dialing involved clockwise finger rotation. Push-button phones became available commercially in1963, but rotary phones remained popular for household use until well into the '70s. Phone calls meant staying in one spot. Unless you had a really long cord. A cordless phone prototype was invented in 1965, but it didn't become popular for residential use until the early '80s. The first cell phone came along in 1979, followed by the digital cell phone 1988. Local calls were only 7 digits.** Calling someone in the same town didn't require an area code until the early 2000s, when, the New York Times reported, telecomm regulators began facing "number exhaustion" due to an expanding population. Getting a credit card was a breeze. In fact, many were opened by credit card companies on behalf of the recipient without their consent. Consumers received active cards in the mail that they hadn't even applied for. The Unsolicited Credit Card Act of 1970 put a stop to that practice. Chicken pox killed 100 children a year in the U.S. Before a vaccine came along in 1995, rest and calamine lotion were the best treatments for the itchy disease. Catholics were okay with the pill. Pope Paul VI hadn't yet released his July 1968 report, Humanae Vitae ("on human life"), doubling down on the church's anti-contraceptive stance, which some cardinals and bishops had previously voted to roll back. No U.S. president had ever resigned. Although that would soon change: President Richard Nixon was elected in 1968. Soda cans had pull tabs. Beaches used to be littered with the shrapnel of discarded soda-can pull tabs (hence the Jimmy Buffett lyrics "I blew out my flip flop/Stepped on a pop top") prior to the invention of the push-through tab in 1975. Cigarette ads played on TV. Prior to a ban that became effective September 1970, tobacco companies advertised on TV and radio for the general U.S. population to see and hear—including little eyes and ears. Lenders could discriminate based on gender or race. When the Equal Credit Opportunity Act passed in 1974, it outlawed discrimination against applicants based on gender, race, marital status, national origin, or religion. Skin cancer was an afterthought. Although the first effective sunscreens were developed in the 1940s, they generally had SPFs below 10. The FDA proposed its first sunscreen guidelines in 1978, simply stating, "In the long run, suntanning is not good for the skin." Playgrounds were relatively dangerous. Hot metal slides, see-saws that required way too much trust in your fellow kid, and tire swings that harbored spiders and other insects were just the beginning. Builders still used hazardous materials like asbestos. The EPA's ban on asbestos-laden fireproofing and other installation didn't happen until 1973. Getting kids to take their vitamins was a challenge. Yummy Flintstones vitamins hit the market in 1968 but the real kid favorite, gummy vitamins, didn't appear until 1997. Millions more people suffered from untreated depression. Prozac, the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), entered the market in 1987. Since then, more than 35 million people around the world have taken the drug to combat symptoms of depression. The internet hadn't even been invented. The internet's predecessor, ARPAnet, developed as an alternative means of government communication should telephones fail, sent its first message in 1969. Pictured above is the first Interface Message Processor (IMP), similar to a rudimentary Wi-Fi router. There was no fast track to fat loss. Italian gynecologist Giorgio Fischer invented liposuction in 1974. Computers took up entire rooms. Floppy disks and microprocessors made the devices more manageable in the '70s, but IBM's PC (1981) and Apple's Macintosh (1984) brought the computer home. Child car seats weren't regulated. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration set the first standards in 1971, requiring that all seats be held by safety belts and include a harness to keep the child in place. Millions more people sported eyeglasses. Glass contact lenses existed, but a more comfortable alternative became available in 1971 with the debut of soft contact lenses, followed by disposables 16 years later. Babe Ruth was still the Home Run King. Hank Aaron beat Ruth's record for the most home runs in 1974, and the current record holder, Barry Bonds, surpassed Aaron in 2007 with 755. Walmart was a mom-and-pop. The Walton Family had just 24 stores in 1967. Walmart became a publicly traded company in 1970. 'Made in China' items were hard to find. The Korean War put a freeze on all U.S.-China trade and travel until the early '70s, when President Nixon's administration reestablished diplomatic relations. There were only three major TV networks. Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In, pictured above, aired on one of them: NBC. ABC and CBS were the other two. (A previous contender, DuMont, shut down in 1956.) Fox joined the lineup in 1986 but didn't earn "major network" status until 1994. Iran was America's ally. Diplomatic relations crumbled after Iran's 1979 revolution, which overthrew the pro-American Shah (pictured with Queen Farah and their daughter in London) and installed anti-American Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini. The Iran Hostage Crisis later that year further complicated matters. The U.S. was at war in Vietnam. Despite widespread protests, the Vietnam War continued until April 30, 1975, bringing the total conflict time to 19 years, 5 months, 4 weeks and 1 day. And the draft was active. The government employed conscription from 1940 until 1973, even during times of peace, to supplement armed forces without enough voluntary recruits. Muhammad Ali, above, right, was convicted of draft evasion in 1967 after refusing to join because of religious objections. His conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. The environment was an afterthought. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was formed in 1970. No one cared about bottled water. Americans preferred soda or beer. That is until Perrier launched a mass marketing campaign in 1977 to attract status-hungry Baby Boomers. The U.S. Senate had never had a black woman representative. Carol Moseley Braun made history when she was elected to the Senate on Nov. 3, 1992. Corporal punishment was widely used in public schools. In 1977, the Supreme Court upheld that the Eighth Amendment's "cruel and unusual punishments" clause did not apply to disciplinary actions in schools in the case Ingraham v. Wright. At the time only two states had laws against corporal punishment in schools. (Today, 19 states still find inflicting bodily pain an acceptable means of discipline.) Radio was the only means of portable music. Until Stereobelt developed the first portable cassette player in '72, transistor radio was it. Sports and politics rarely intertwined. Which is why U.S. Olympians Tommie Smith and John Carlos made headlines worldwide with their Black Power salutes during the 1968 games. "If I win I am an American, not a black American. But if I did something bad then they would say 'a  gro.' We are black and we are proud of being black," Smith later said. 
Why is a Parkland student barefoot on the 'Time' magazine cover?|The newest Time magazine cover features five Parkland, Florida, students, one of whom is barefoot. Jaclyn Corin, toes out, stands alongside other #NeverAgain movement leaders from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School: Emma González, David Hogg, Cameron Kasky and Alex Wind. There isn't any hidden meaning in her lack of footwear on the cover, meant to illustrate how the school shooting generation has had "enough." Corin said it was simply a personal choice. "I didn’t feel like it — plain and simple," Corin tweeted. "Hippies didn’t wear shoes in the 60’s so I’m just jumping on the bandwagon." Before the Valentine’s Day shooting, Corin had delivered carnations to raise money for junior prom to the very same building Nikolas Cruz would kill 17 people, Time reports. She gave a flower to a girl who was shot minutes later. Corin is the school's junior class president who wrote a 50-page term paper on gun control, Time reports, and most recently, she organized travel for about 100 students to the state legislature in Florida's capital Tallahassee.
5 Reasons Tinder Is Dead And Is Never Coming Back|We get it, meeting people can be hard, so it's a no wonder everyone's downloading dating apps faster than teenage boys download pictures of topless women. Everyone wants to meet someone and preferably without having to troll every local bar for potential dates. For a while, Tinder was every lazy persons solution to dating and it was kind of fun. That was until we realised that giving people too many options mean that everyone on Tinder, likes to keep their options open; and that's not even the only problem. If all this sounds a little too familiar then you'll probably agree with our personal reasons for choosing to delete Tinder... once and for all. 1. Because we are so bored of casual hook-ups Tinder has made it ridiculously easy to find a companion for the night, as opposed to for life. 2. Because we can't remember the last conversation we had on Tinder which didn’t involve being asked for a “sexy picture” Which should be no surprise to anyone because Tinder matches are pretty much based on how hot someone thinks your pictures are. 3. Because there's a new dating app on the scene doesn't involve swipe-related thumb cramp It was only a matter of time, before someone came up with a smarter app for people who actually want to DATE. One app on the scene which we kind of love is the Once dating app. Once uses human matchmakers to offer you one match per day, which is suited to you, based on essential information. You then have 24 hours to spark up a conversation and see if you are compatible. The days of endless swiping are over and have been replaced with an app that does the hard work for you. All you have to do, is be your witty charming self. 4. Because Tinder has made everyone kind of shallow We get it, looks are important, but believe it or not, there are other factors you should consider when trying to find a partner. Tinder's philosophy seems to involve throwing as many random matches at you as possible and hope you find some of them hot. Because too many options make everyone disposable No one is required to make effort, because another match is just a couple of swipes away. Tinder is kind of like putting a child in a doughnut factory and telling them that they can have as many doughnuts as they like. In that situation, any child would grab as many doughnuts as possible... but probably won't really appreciate any of them. After all, why spend all your time on the Maple Bacon when you can take a bite then chase it with an original glazed. where do we go from here? Deleting Tinder for the third time might be a good idea. Trying to find love in a more organic way might be an option and if that fails, give another app a try. The Once dating app offers quality matches over quantity, which might be crazy enough to work.
Guitar Center’s $1 billion in debt reveals this truth about musical tastes|Guitar Center, the nation’s leading musical-instrument retailer, is in trouble. Changing musical tastes are partly to blame. Ratings agency S&P Global downgraded Westlake Village-based Guitar Center Holdings Inc. for the second time last week as the troubled instrument retailer seeks to refinance and restructure more than $1 billion of debt. “Most of what’s really selling today is rap and hip hop,” said George Gruhn, owner of the Gruhn Guitars shop in Nashville. “That’s outpacing other forms of music and they don’t use a lot of recognizable musical instruments.” Shifting demographics The company’s challenges speak to shifting demographics, something Gruhn is well acquainted with. Guitars don’t figure as heavily into chart-topping music as they once did, says. He ought to know. Over the years, his customers have included everyone from Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Eric Clapton to Neil Young, Vince Gill and Billy Gibbons. Those artists have left indelible imprints on the music landscape, all the way from Clapton’s burning solo on “Crossroads” to Harrison’s signature guitar part on “Daytripper.” But these days? Well, things aren’t as guitar-oriented. “Baby boomers are the best customers I’ve ever had. They’ve driven a lot of the guitar trends, but they are aging and many of them are downsizing their guitar collections,” he added. “This doesn’t mean that guitar sales are dying, but instrument sales in general are under stress.” No more guitar heroes The instrument is also facing an identity crisis. Guitar heroes – who have inspired many a player and fueled strong instrument sales – are few and far between these days, according to Gruhn. “I would be hard-pressed to name any new ones,” he said. “You’ve got Joe Bonamassa who is a great player. But he isn’t selling as many guitars as the other big time heroes. And Eric Clapton is arthritic. He’s having difficulty playing and is retiring from touring.” Concotilli, owner of Mugzey Music in Canyon Country, spoke to the shifting demographics. “Rock is almost dead,” he said. “It’s almost nonexistent. And with guitar there’s no almost one to look up to anymore – no one to get you to want to learn. I have three or four guitar students who are about 12 to 14 years old, and I told one of them she should find someone in her class to play guitar with. She said, ‘No one else plays the guitar, and people think I’m weird because I do.’ ” To lazy to learn? The bigger problem, according to Concotelli, is that most aspiring players don’t want to put in the time to become proficient on the instrument. “If they do want to learn they’ll just go to YouTube, but they’re not getting the proper instruction,” he said. “With kids these days, it’s all about instant gratification. No one wants to take six months or a year to learn. They don’t want to do the work.” A report released last year by the Washington Post revealed electric guitar sales have plummeted over the past decade from about 1.5 million sold annually to just over 1 million. The two biggest companies, Gibson and Fender, are in debt, and a third, PRS Guitars, had to cut staff and expand production of cheaper guitars, the report said. Gruhn acknowledged that the demand for both acoustic and electric instruments has fallen. “I think the guitar market was built up into a bubble at a pace that was unsustainable,” he said. “It’s leveled off to something that reflects more normalcy. Factories that were designed to produce 100,000 instruments a year may now find that their demand has dropped to 75,000, and that’s a problem because now you have higher overhead.” Still, Guitar Center has forged on. The company currently operates more than 280 stores throughout the U.S. with Southern California locations in such communities as Westlake Village, Stevenson Ranch, Sherman Oaks, Northridge, Pasadena, Glendora, Rancho Cucamonga, San Bernardino and Orange. The financial strains Last week, S&P lowered the company’s rating to CC from CCC- and issued a negative outlook. Guitar Center has issued $635 million in senior secured notes that will be due in 2021. Those notes and some additional cash will be used to refinance the company’s existing $615 million in secured notes which carry a lower interest rate and were set to mature next month, according to S&P. By extending the timeline on its debt, Guitar Center will achieve increased liquidity and boost its financial stability for the next three years. Still, analysts with S&P view the exchange as distressed because it falls short of the original bonds’ promise and creditors view it as a form of default. Guitar Center declined to comment beyond the news of its debt restructuring. School of Rock One of the brighter spots in the industry these days can be found in School of Rock, a Canton, Massachusetts-based chain of 207 music schools which span 10 countries worldwide. Elliott Baldini, the company’s senior vice president of marketing, said the schools are designed to draw students in by giving them more of what they actually want to learn. “Music is at its core a social activity,” he said. “People get inspired to play because they listen to their favorite artists or see them at a live venue. But that experience isn’t translated when you take music lessons. It’s usually a very solitary, one-on-one experience experience with one teacher and the students aren’t necessarily learning the play the songs they want to learn.” School of Rock offers something different, according to Baldini. “We teach students of all ages the same music theory they’d learn anywhere else, but you learn to use that theory with a band. Students have group rehearsals where they can practice with a band every week. And we also have our version of a recital, which is really a rock show at a live venue. We put on more than 3,000 shows a year across the world.” School of Rock has Southern California schools in Santa Clarita, Woodland Hills, Burbank, Pasadena, Redondo Beach, Tustin and Rancho Santa Margarita, among other locations. 
The Real Reason Donald Trump Always Eats Fast Food Will Make You Feel Bad for Him|A professional would have to talk to Trump to diagnose him with a mental illness. But you don’t have to have a degree in nutrition to know a diet consisting primarily of fast food isn’t a particularly healthy lifestyle choice. As Newsweek reports, “Trump may be right about fast food restaurants being cleaner than other establishments, according to one very small study. But drive-thru meals aren’t known for being healthy.” Trump’s diet seems fueled by several fears — but not by fear of the adverse health effects of high-fat foods. Newsweek notes that “many factors determine how a lifetime of Big Macs and fries will impact your body, including genetics and lifestyle factors such as physical activity or smoking.” For instance, a fast food diet might do more harm if you don’t offset it by staying physically active. 
Is Matt Damon Really Moving To Australia To Get Away From Donald Trump? The Truth|Is Matt Damon seriously considering uprooting his family to Australia because of Donald Trump? A new report claims so, but it may not be entirely accurate. Here’s what’s going on. Does Matt Damon hate Donald Trump so much that he’d move down under to get away from his politics? “Matt’s telling friends and colleagues in Hollywood that the he’s moving the family to Australia,” because the 47-year-old disagrees with the President’s policies, sources told Page Six. “Matt’s saying the move will not impact his work — as he will travel to wherever his projects are shooting. He’s also telling friends he wants to have a safe place to raise his kids.” But the move isn’t happening. The actor’s publicist, Jennifer Allen, told The Boston Globe that there aren’t any plans for the Good Will Hunting star to uproot his wife Luciana Barroso and their four kids to another continent. “Matt has visited Australia several times recently, but he has not bought a house there nor is he moving there,” she told the newspaper in an e-mail. There you have it! While the current administration isn’t enough to get the Ocean’s 8 star to emigrate to another country, he is critical of Trump. When the former Celebrity Apprentice host was running his presidential campaign, Matt said he was “nervous” about the possibility of him being elected. “There’s no way we can let this guy be the [president],” he said. “To let that dude have the nuclear football, are you kidding me? He’s impulsive and rash, and doesn’t seem to think deeply about too many things.” Now that we’re more than a year into Trump’s presidency, I think it’s safe to say that the Academy Award winner was right. Matt also condemned Trump blaming “both sides” for the violence involving white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia as “absolutely abhorrent.” Again, accurate. 
The CEO of Arby's has begun turning around newly acquired Buffalo Wild Wings with a simple first step|Paul Brown so effectively revitalized Arby's since taking over as CEO in 2013 that the fast-food brand's parent company has placed him at the helm of a new holding company dedicated to replicating that success. The new company, Inspire Brands, was formed around Arby's and the acquisition of Buffalo Wild Wings, along with small regional brand R Taco. Business Insider recently spoke with Brown about his new role, and he explained that he'll be re-applying the processes he learned at Arby's to Buffalo Wild Wings. Chief among them: asking employees around the country what they would do if they were in charge. "I'm a very visual and experiential person," Brown said, "and when I'm thinking about where the brand can be and what it can do, it's just getting out there and asking a lot of questions: 'What about this? What's worked here? What happens when the restaurant's full? What happens when you get a lot of delivery orders? Is this desk in the right place?' All that kind of stuff that you can't really get your hands around when looking at reports." In 2013, Brown became the Arby's CEO as an outsider. Private equity firm Roark Capital hired Brown for his work at the hotel group Hilton Worldwide, and he knew that he had to work hard to earn his employees' and franchisees' trust, especially after a wave of changes to the executive team that left them unconvinced he would even last. Brown explained to Business Insider last year that he decided to use his position as an outsider to his advantage and learn from the frontlines. He embarked on "listening tour," traveling the United States and asking franchisees what they would do in his position. For his first three months on the job, he said, he spent more than half his time outside of Arby's headquarters and spoke to around 1,000 employees. Even back at the office, he spent his first several meetings with the leadership team mostly silent, taking copious notes. He said that the approach revealed to him insights about Arby's supply chain and advertising campaigns that he never would have seen had he come in behaving as if he had all the answers.

As the head of Inspire, Brown has less time to be in the field than he had back in 2013, but he's still using this first phase of transforming Buffalo Wild Wings to listen to his workforce. He's already met with the 12 biggest franchisees in the US, and is hosting a summit of all the franchisees and operations teams in March. He's begun considering ideas these franchisees have raised, around issues like food and order flows and seating arrangements. Brown said that he recognizes that when he's making decisions that affect Buffalo Wild Wings franchisees, he's dealing with people who have invested in the long term with these businesses, and often pass them on to their children. Because Inspire is private, he and his team will be able to make changes without rushing them, he said, allowing them to establish relationships with these franchisees. "We've made it clear that we look at this like a long-term investment — we're not in and out, and we also appreciate the fact that it's a trust thing," he said.
