      "Ethnic minority voters abandon Labour Ethnic minority voters abandon Labour: Poll finds collapse in numbers of Indian, Caribbean and Africans who support the party since 2010  215 shares 475 comments Labour has traditionally benefited from the ethnic minority vote But number of Indian voters who say they identify with party falls to 18% Figure was 77% in 1997, and support among other groups has also fallen Labour received 68% of ethnic minority votes in 2010 election Conservative share was 16%, up from 10% in 2005 Ethic minority voters are abandoning Labour according to a poll which shows the number of Indian, African and Caribbeans who support the party has fallen since 2010. The party has traditionally benefited from the ethnic minority vote, especially with people of Afro-Caribbean descent. However, figures from the British Election Study reportedly show that the number of African voters who say they identify with Ed Miliband's party has slipped from 79 to 63 per cent since 1997, while Caribbean support has fallen from 78 to 67 per cent. Scroll down for video  Ethic minority voters are abandoning Labour according to a poll which shows the number of Indian, African and Caribbeans who support the party has fallen since 2010 More worrying for Miliband will be Indian support collapsing from 77 per cent to just 18 per cent - a fall of more than three-quarters - while support among people of Pakistani origin has fallen from 77 to 57 per cent, according to the figures revealed by the Telegraph.  'The ethnic minorities are seen to be the core of Labour party vote, they have been for years, for decades but I will make these people here representing Labour a little bit uncomfortable about this assumption that minorities will vote for them as a matter of course,' Dr Maria Sobolewska, an expert from Manchester University and part of the team conducting the Ethnic Minority British Election Study, told a conference this month, according to the newspaper's website. News that Labour is falling out of favour with ethnic minority voters comes after research released earlier this year predicted that Britain's black and ethnic minority communities could account for almost a third of the population by 2050. Ed Miliband outlines Labour's spending plan if elected (related) Research released earlier this year predicted that Britain's black and ethnic minority communities could account for almost a third of the population by 2050 Currently, eight million people, or 14 per cent of the UK population, are from ethnic minorities. But they now account for 80 per cent of population growth, while the white population remains constant. Experts from think-tank Policy Exchange predict that as a result, by the middle of the century between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of the population – up to 16million people – will be from a minority community. In the last election, the Conservatives received 16 per cent of ethnic minority votes, while Labour had 68 per cent, according to the Ethnic Minority British Election Study which was undertaken by researchers from Oxford, Manchester and Essex Universities. Research by Ipsos Mori showed the Conservative share in 2010 had increased from the 2005 election when the party got just ten per cent of votes cast by ethnic minority voters. Boris Johnson announces he will stand as MP in 2015 (related) Conservative strategist Lynton Crosby told Conservative MPs they should look to Boris Johnson's mayoral campaign, which won over large sections of the non-white community In October, Conservative strategist Lynton Crosby said David Cameron needed to do more to win over voters from minority background. He told MPs they should look to Boris Johnson’s mayoral campaign, which won over large sections of the non-white community. In a meeting at the Tory party conference, Crosby - who ran Johnson's 2012 campaign - said it had seen 'Boris outperform the Conservative party by 40% in the BME [black minority ethnic] communities'.  But Dr Sobolewska said if voters from minority backgrounds were turning away from Labour, that did not necessarily mean they would give their support to the Conservatives - despite Tory attempts to win departing Labour voters over. 'They [the Conservatives] don't think for the effort they are putting in they are getting enough back - in fact they think what is going to happen to them is this so-called death by demographics that has been advertised as something that is already happening to the republicans in the US,' she said. 215 shares 475 comments Proud mother!

      "Korean Mobile Media Company Yello Mobile Raises $100M From Formation 8 At A $1B Valuation Korea-based startup Yello Mobile has raised $100 million from Formation 8 at a $1 billion valuation. You probably haven’t heard about Yello Mobile if you live outside of Asia, but the startup has set its sights on becoming one of the region’s largest mobile media companies through a series of acquisitions. Its latest funding puts the total Yello Mobile has raised since it was founded in August 2012 at $176 million. Its current valuation means Yello Mobile in now in the same league as other Korean tech unicorns, including Line (though mainly based in Japan, the messaging app is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Korean Internet giant Naver), Daumkakao, Nexon, Com2Us, and Coupang.   The company operates in several different verticals: mobile shopping and advertising, mobile travel, O2O (online to offline) business, as well as mobile content and media. The capital will be used to acquire more mobile app startups, as well as on marketing. Yello Mobile CEO Sanghyuk Lee told TechCrunch “we will continuously acquire companies related to mobile shopping and mobile advertising, mobile travel, online to offline business, and mobile content as we have been doing since our establishment.” Yello’s portfolio currently has about 50 startups, including included Indonesian price comparison site PriceArea and AlarmMon, a clock app based in Seoul. Though most of its acquisitions are Korean, Yello Mobile, looks for potential buys throughout Asia, except for China, which the company has yet to enter. After acquiring a startup, Yello Mobile requires that founders and share holders remain as employees for three to five years, unless they sell their stock back to Yello. Lee told Korean tech blog BeSuccess last month that it plans to hold an initial public offering next year. 0 SHARES 0 Share 0 Tweet 0 Share Advertisement Advertisement CrunchBase Yello Mobile Founded 2012     Overview Yellomobile Service Incubating Center (옐로모바일 서비스인큐베이팅센터) provides startups with services for member development, design, marketing, and operations.

      "Venezuela to release $2.1 bln in hard currency to companies CARACAS, May 30 (Reuters) - Venezuela will begin releasing $2.1 billion in hard currency to companies that have struggled to obtain greenbacks through currency controls, the country's top economic official said on Friday. Some $1.2 billion of the payments will go to small and medium-sized businesses in the food, health, chemicals and heavy industry sectors, Economy Vice President Rafael Ramirez told reporters. Ramirez said $930 million more will be disbursed to larger companies, including $486 million for airlines. Delays in Venezuela's currency controls have left many companies unable to import machinery or raw materials, while foreign companies such as airlines have been unable to repatriate revenue from Venezuelan operations. Venezuela's local airline industry association said on Thursday that 24 international airlines have an estimated $4.2 billion trapped in the country due to currency controls. The finance minister earlier this week said Venezuela made pending currency disbursements to six airlines, without detailing the amounts.

      "5 ways to make sure a college education pays off Around this time every year, there is usually a barrage of stories in the media about the ever-escalating amounts of student loan debt. These are accompanied by news of the college majors that pay the most – and, conversely, those that pay the least. Don’t pay any attention to the advice embedded within those stories. If you want your child to be miserable, encourage them to pick a college major based on what career pays the most when they are a high school senior. Nothing could be more short-sighted than picking a major based on the earnings for one year. Your child might work for 50 years after graduation. How likely is it that the major they pick based on one year’s earnings will pay well for a half-century? The field might not even exist in the future. Many of the highest paying entry-level jobs today didn’t exist 10 years ago. Things change. Here are some ways to help guide your child in making the decisions that can lead to a happier career. 1. Tell your child to pick something they love and find a way to make money from it. With the rise of the Internet, it is easier than ever to become an expert in a field and to make money from it as an entrepreneur. There are people in every field doing that right now and there are a million ways to make a great living in this country. In my business I am always amazed at the different ways my clients have found to be successful. You know the guy who lives in the big house on the hill in your town? Chances are he probably didn’t choose his major because the earnings for it happened to be high when he went to college. It’s more likely that he found something he was passionate about and learned all he could about it. He probably got an advanced or professional degree in a subject or two and became such an expert that people were willing to pay him a premium for his skills, services and/or products. 2. Make your child plan for college like they would a business and encourage them to be creative. If your child goes to college for four years, taking courses with no plan, and then starts sending out their resume in the spring of their senior year, then yes, they will struggle and you will wonder what the heck you just spent $250,000 on. Instead, they need to consider each course as an investment in time and money, and they need to figure out how each course will help them before they sign up for it. Yes, I know there will be some required courses. They should still figure out how to get the most out of them. Maybe it’s the content; maybe it’s the connections with the professor or other students. There will be something. 3.  If they aren’t sure yet what to major in, tell them to take all of their required courses first and see what they like. I was an undecided business major for almost two years. Then I became hooked on finance and went with it. In my MBA program, I stuck with finance because it was familiar. In law school I figured I might break from business and finance, but guess what? I found out that it really was what I liked so I took courses in finance, tax and estate planning. I worked for a couple of years as a lawyer and I hated every second of it. Fifteen years ago I made a break from working as a lawyer and started working as a financial planner. The courses that I took in tax and finance didn’t help me much as a lawyer, but have come in handy ever since. Now I get paid very well to do a job I love where I get to help people every day. What could be better than that? 4.  Just like their choice of a major, make sure your child has a plan for how they will pay for college. They can’t just go in and hope for the best. Don’t be afraid to steer them toward community college and state school or to take a little longer to decide if they need to. 5.  Tell them not to be afraid to take out student loans just because they will have debt. It’s hard to go to college now without loans or semi-affluent parents who are generous. Debt is not evil; it’s very useful sometimes. Student loan debt can also be a good thing for your credit scores — when paid on time, over time — and many graduates could use that opportunity to build credit. (If you want to see how student loan debt affects your credit, there are many resources that allow you to check your credit scores for free, including Credit.com.) Also, the average student loan debt is about what a new car costs. Which one will provide them more value in the future? It’s education, by a mile. One last thing: Help them if you can really afford it, but don’t jeopardize your own retirement. They still have 50 years of earnings ahead of them, you don’t.

      "Stephen Harper Gave An 'Exclusive' Interview To Costco Magazine Copyright © 2015 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | \"The Huffington Post\" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. All rights reserved. Stephen Harper Gave An 'Exclusive' Interview To Costco Magazine Jennifer MacMillan The Huffington Post Canada Posted: 02/26/15 02:22 PM ET Updated: 02/26/15 02:59 PM ET Stephen Harper has never been known for being terribly accessible to journalists. The Prime Minister does not often give sit-down interviews — except at the end of the year, when he typically speaks to a very select number of news outlets... and Costco magazine. Costco Connection, the \"lifestyle magazine for Costco members,\" was able to capture some of the PM's valuable time. In their March/April issue, the magazine published a two-page spread featuring an \"exclusive\" interview with Harper from last December. The interview raised some eyebrows on Twitter — along with the fact it was designer guru Sarah Richardson who made the cover, not the Prime Minister of Canada. What's more hilarious? @pmharper giving an \"exclusive\" interview to @costcocanada, or that it's not the cover story? pic.twitter.com/79nYDyKWpv— Elias Makos (@eliasmakos) February 26, 2015 The retail giant's former Canadian country manager, Louise Wendling, conducted the interview with Harper. The pair discussed topics ranging from the Tories' tax benefits for families, income splitting and the party's small business tax credit. No word on the PM's favourite Kirkland-brand products. .\n",

      "A Chinese Gold Standard? LONDON — While the 70th anniversary of D-Day last month received a lot of attention, another event, in July 1944 — the Bretton Woods conference, named for the mountain resort in New Hampshire where it was held — was perhaps even more significant in shaping the modern world. It not only led to the creation of what are now the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, but it also confirmed the central position of the United States dollar in the international monetary system. Why does this matter for us now? Just as America displaced Britain as the world’s pre-eminent economic power in the interwar period, so, too, the large debts and fiscal pressures confronting the West, and the rise of China and other economic powers, challenge us to think about the future of finance. For most of the 19th century the British pound had been the world’s “reserve currency,” the currency in which trade and finance were denominated. “As sound as a pound” became a widely used expression. The pound was pegged to gold at a fixed rate of just under £4 per ounce. At the outbreak of World War I, Britain abandoned the gold standard. You could no longer exchange pounds for gold. The gold standard was reintroduced in 1925, but this, as John Maynard Keynes observed, proved to be an economic mistake. British prices and, more crucially, wages, would have to be forced down by 10 percent to maintain the competitiveness of British exports. As American agricultural and industrial exports soared in the 1920s and 1930s, the dollar effectively replaced the pound. It was American bankers who helped out the financially strapped Weimar Republic in the 1920s. The British, as exporters of capital, were a diminished force. By the time of Bretton Woods, the United States held roughly 60 percent of the world’s gold supply. “Think of the gold in Fort Knox,” America’s chief negotiator at Bretton Woods, Harry Dexter White, said. “That is why we are in a powerful position.” He added, “We have the wherewithal to buy any currency we want.” Bretton Woods fixed the dollar price of gold at $35 per ounce, and all the other major currencies — the pound, the franc, the mark, the yen — were subsequently pegged to the dollar, even though they could not be exchanged directly for gold. This system lasted until 1971. By then, America was under the financial strain of the Vietnam War and Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society. With mounting deficits and an adverse balance of trade, America struggled to maintain gold convertibility at the old rate of $35 an ounce. So President Richard M. Nixon abandoned the fixed dollar price of gold established at Bretton Woods (over the objections of the Federal Reserve chairman, Arthur F. Burns). International critics said that the United States, by ending the dollar link to gold, was turning its back on its responsibilities as the guarantor of the international monetary system. Over the decades, the situation has gotten worse. The United States is $17.6 trillion in debt owed to the public, and large trade deficits are the norm. Yet there is no scope for revisiting the international monetary system, despite great dissatisfaction by countries like China and the Persian Gulf states, which hold large foreign currency reserves. Americans themselves question the security of the dollar when their country faces such large trade and budget deficits. China’s nearly $4 trillion in reserves — accumulated through its mercantilist trade policies — give it plenty of ammunition to claim leadership in the creation of a new monetary order. The Chinese, however, are most unlikely to bid for monetary hegemony in the near future. For the past 25 years they have pursued a policy of aggressive export growth to drive their economy. China successively devalued its currency, from 1.50 renminbi to the dollar in 1980, to 8.72 in 1994. (Today the renminbi trades at 6.20 to the dollar, which the United States still considers artificially low.) Could China someday peg its currency to gold, as Britain did in 1821? China has the reserves to do this, and it could have the political will, if the dollar proved to be unreliable as a store of value in the future. Of course, Britain’s earlier adoption of the gold standard, in 1821, worsened a sharp deflationary period, during which, according to one calculation, consumer prices fell nearly 50 percent, between 1818 and 1822. Nevertheless, to its supporters the gold standard ensured British fiscal and monetary dominance during the rest of the 19th century. As the British historian A.J.P. Taylor observed, 19th-century Britons believed that “a country could not flourish without a balanced budget and a gold currency.” Since Keynes, the West has tried to deny this proposition, with our reliance on deficit spending and “fiat” money, backed mainly by the expectation that a government will not default on its debts. China is not as indebted as the West, but it is looking to “rebalance” its economy by raising demand by consumers, who want to enjoy the standard of living enjoyed across the Western world. Since 2010, the renminbi has appreciated 14 percent without drastically hurting Chinese exports. Having expanded its manufacturing base and captured international markets, China may well find a world hooked on its products. It could eventually — in, say, 20 years — peg the renminbi to gold, considering it preferable to the dollar as a store of value, because of its permanence and longevity. With a balanced budget and a gold-backed currency, China’s economy could be even more formidable than it is today. Such a move would truly mark its return as the “Middle Kingdom.” Hard as it may be to contemplate today, this scenario would, in many ways, be a more secure basis for an international monetary regime system than the system of floating exchange rates that Nixon inadvertently created in 1971, one that forever overturned the Bretton Woods order.

      "Islam's Way to End Violence Against Women? Civilized Men \"She made me do it.\" I hear this phrase all too often, and each time I hear it my heart bleeds. In my pro bono legal practice, I represent indigent women who suffer or have suffered through domestic violence. As an attorney, as a Muslim, as a husband, and as an uncle to five beautiful nieces, I see my clients as individuals that could just as easily be my family. My clients are white, black, Asian and Latino. They are Muslim, Christian, agnostic and undeclared. They remind me that violence against women is a worldwide epidemic--and that such violence is the leading cause of injury to women in America. Part of the client interview process seeks to understand the underlying roots that led to the abuse. While I know the reason, the point is to understand what they believe caused the violence against them. Invariably, my DV client will at some point claim, \"He said I provoked him, that I made him do it.\" Sometimes I can no longer tell if they actually believe what they're saying, or have been beaten -- literally or figuratively -- into believing it. A recent Washington Post article argues that marriage is the Holy Grail to ensure women avoid domestic abuse and violence, claiming, \"Married women are notably safer than their unmarried peers, and girls raised in a home with their married father are markedly less likely to be abused or assaulted than children living without their own father.\" Therefore, the authors conclude \"one way to end violence against women [is] married dads.\" For the sake of argument, I'll believe the article is well-intentioned. Unfortunately, in analyzing extensive data and turning women into statistics, the article -- at best -- succeeds in some colorful bar graphs reporting on women who are slightly less abused than other women. The article woefully misses the main reason behind why violence against women exists, and therefore it misses the correct solution to stop that violence. A woman's dress, marital status, and lifestyle do not inspire violence against women. Violence against women exists because the men in their lives -- single, married and strangers -- commit that violence. Violence against women exists because men do not treat women with respect. Violence against women exists because our society does not value the moral characteristics of civility in discourse, respect for a woman's body, respect for a woman's right to self-determination, and the equality and equity of women in general. Instead, we resort to placing the burden of avoiding violence on women, while men escape unscathed. Such an approach is as reprehensible as it is ineffective -- as evidenced by rising DV cases. Recognizing that this approach is contrary to human nature, Prophet Muhammad implemented substantive reform among men to stop violence against women 1400 years ago. Pre-Islam Arabia was a hotbed of misogyny, violence against women, and inequality. Women had no right to property, decision in marriage, right to divorce, or self-determination. Islam first immediately granted women these rights and forbade forcing anything on women. While violence against women is epidemic in some parts of the Muslim world today -- as it is in America and the west -- life for women immediately and for centuries after Islam represents how Islam's pristine teachings ultimately elevated women to a level of equality and reformed men to stop committing violence. For example, to teach respect for a woman's body, Islam stresses chastity -- but places the primary burden for chastity on men, not women. While clerics and priests today declare that women should \"get married\" or \"dress more modestly\" to avoid domestic violence, Prophet Muhammad held a different view. While encouraging marriage and modest dress for both genders, Prophet Muhammad significantly and as a foundation commanded men, \"You be chaste yourselves, and women will be chaste.\" He commanded men to stop obsessing over how women behave and dress, and instead demanded men focus on self-reform and self-improvement. While the Qur'an admonishes women to dress modestly in the footsteps of Mary Mother of Jesus, it instead and first commands men to \"cast down your eyes\" and \"not stare at women lustfully\" -- no matter how a woman chooses to dress. A woman is responsible to herself and God to dress and act modestly, while a man is primarily obligated to women, to himself, and to God to treat women with respect and not gawk. The Qur'an further declares men and women as two equal beings created from a single soul, declares men and women as garments for one another designed to protect one another from harm and suffering, and commands Muslims to speak in a comely and civilized manner. As far as the claim that \"She provoked me,\" the Qur'an emphatically responds, \"Consort with women in kindness, and if you dislike them, it may be you dislike a thing in which God has placed much good.\" The Qur'an further commands men that if a woman indeed commits a flagrant act -- such as infidelity -- a man must first advise her of his disapproval in words, and if still angry separate himself from the volatile situation -- and not cause her physical harm under any circumstance. (My recent book EXTREMIST likewise debunks the myth some espouse that the Qur'an commands men to commit domestic violence). On a journey through the desert, a male driver sped up the heard. Prophet Muhammad, noting that women were traveling with them and would experience discomfort due to the rough ride, admonished the driver to slow down, declaring, \"Mind the crystal!\" Indeed, Muhammad's dying words were \"Treat women well. You have rights over them and they have rights over you. They are your committed partners.\" The strategy worked. Women after Islam rose to levels of unmatched jurists like Hazrat Ayesha, courageous soldiers like Nusayba b. Ka'b al-Anṣārīyya and Khawla b. al-Azwar, brilliant community leaders like Zaynab b. 'Alī, and awe-inspiring academics like Lubna of Cordoba and Fatima al-Fihri of Morocco. This list is but a mere snapshot. Most notably, Islam's solution to stop violence against women is not a religious answer -- it is a secular answer. It obliges men to safeguard their chastity, treat women with equality, take ownership over their own behavior, and respect a woman's body and right to self-determination. Violence against women will stop when men stop committing violence against women. I would like nothing more than my pro bono practice in domestic violence to become obsolete. But as long as we rationalize data to support the preconceived notion that woman are the root cause -- or a cause -- of violence against women, I'll unfortunately have more clients than I can handle. For the sake of humanity, stop blaming women. In the meantime, I'll raise my two young sons with Prophet Muhammad's example -- that the key to stopping violence against women rests with civilized men and their personal ownership.\n",

      "Group Builds Novel Sexual Assault Reporting System -- By Talking To Survivors Founder and Executive Director of Sexual Health Innovations Jessica Ladd (Photo: Sexual Health Innovations) A nonprofit company says it has designed an online system for reporting sexual assaults, for use by colleges and universities. What it has going for it that others don't: It was created with the input of rape survivors and student activists. The third-party sexual assault reporting system is called , and was designed by nonprofit Sexual Health Innovations for use by higher education institutions. Callisto allows a victim to file an incident report online, to \"receive a clear explanation of their reporting options, and then either directly submit the report to their chosen authority or save it as a time-stamped record,\" the company said in its description. Sexual Health Innovations, whose advisory board sexual assault survivors and activists, public health officials and college professors, set up a Crowdrise fundraising page this week to get the Callisto service off the ground. As of Tuesday afternoon, the page had collected $1,250 toward a goal of $10,000, but organizers say they need to raise significantly more -- as much as $200,000 -- to staff it adequately. The Callisto system would allow reporting victims to choose to have their perpetrator reported to authorities immediately if the accused has also been reported as an assailant by another user. The initial victim would also get a notification in the event that an additional report is made. But no other individuals or administrators would have access to the database to see whether any single person is listed as either an assailant or victim. Founder and Executive Director of Sexual Health Innovations Jessica Ladd said this is to maintain privacy and to prevent false reports. But what's unique is that the system itself was developed after more than a year of collecting feedback from sexual assault survivors, including Ladd, who said she experienced sexual violence in college and went through the reporting process. \"The reporting process was not very empowering, but that's where the idea came from,\" Ladd told The Huffington Post. Callisto was developed with input from the anti-sexual assault advocacy and activist groups End Rape On Campus, Futures Without Violence, Know Your IX, Surviving in Numbers, the Clery Center, Faculty Against Rape and the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. Ladd said developers interviewed 43 college sexual assault survivors and more than 100 other individuals, ages 18 to 30. She also suggested that, based on their interviews, had a system like Callisto been in place at the time of their assaults, the rate of reporting among their interviewees would have tripled. \"We want to be clear: This is by survivors, for survivors,\" Ladd said, \"and us understanding and having empathy for the trauma that survivors go through after a sexual assault and just how scary the reporting process is.\" Multiple studies show that between 20 percent and 25 percent of women experience sexual assault by the time they graduate from college, but few report it. Less than 5 percent of completed and attempted rapes of women in college get reported to the criminal justice system, according to one Bureau of Justice Statistics/Department of Justice report, and the number drops still further for other types of sexual assault. Since so few are reported at all, however, experts suggest the small numbers included in annual college crime statistics paint a false picture. \"We'll probably have to choose a happy medium between what the schools say they need to accurately understand the problem on the campus, without threatening the anonymity of survivors,\" Ladd said, suggesting that Callisto could deliver relevant statistics via an updating dashboard of most recent reports or through annual reports. \"We want to make it very clear to survivors they control who it's reported to and when,\" Ladd said.\n",

      "Michael Kennedy interview: a life devoted to music and to Manchester Three careers in one: Michael Kennedy at home Picture: Pal Hansen By Ivan Hewett 5:27PM GMT 31 Dec 2014 Telegraph journalist Michael Kennedy, who started as a tea boy and went on to edit the Oxford Dictionary of Music, has died at the age of 88. Early in 2014, he met Ivan Hewett to discuss his lifelong musical passions If he weren’t so easy-going and engaging, Michael Kennedy would be seriously intimidating – especially for a critic. This is the man who’s written authoritative books on half-a-dozen composers, and a musical dictionary that sits on every music-lover’s shelf, and been on friendly terms with luminaries of the musical world for at least half a century. He’s been a distinguished reviewer of concerts and opera, for both the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph. And he was for some years editor of the Northern edition of the Daily Telegraph. In effect he’s had two if not three careers in parallel, and along the way has acquired enough miscellaneous experience of life, newspapers and music to fill several volumes of memoirs – though he’s too naturally modest to think of doing such a thing. Michael Kennedy is now in his mid-eighties, and still writing for the Sunday Telegraph. He and Joyce, the one-time GP who’s been his partner and collaborator since the mid 1970s, live in a modest bungalow in a Manchester suburb. It’s packed full of memorabilia of the composers Kennedy holds dear, especially Mahler, Elgar and Strauss. Advertisement It’s Strauss who’s provided the occasion for my visit, as Kennedy has been appointed Honorary Patron of Strauss’s Voice, a concert series centred around Strauss’s orchestral songs, which begins on January 9. “It’s because my book on Strauss was one of the first serious studies of him in English,” he explains, “so I’ve become a sort of guru of Strauss studies. I think it’s a wonderful idea to pull all three of Manchester’s orchestras together to celebrate him.” I’m struck by how essentially youthful, even boyish Kennedy is. He has the unlined complexion of a man thirty years younger. I ask what made him take on Strauss as a topic when no one else took him seriously. “Well that was the point, really. I thought he was a great and underrated composer. People in the 1940s would sneer that the only interesting thing in a performance of Strauss’s Alpine Symphony was when the wind machine fell over. That kind of talk annoyed me.” Kennedy has a way of setting his jaw in a determined way as he says this. It’s a glint of the steel that has allowed him to take on an incredible workload for much of his working life. When he was immersed in the enormous labour of researching and writing the Oxford Dictionary of Music, he was also editing the Northern edition of this newspaper, which could mean working from 6pm until 2am. Later, when he relinquished the editorship to become a critic, there was pressure of a different sort. “Michael had to dash out of the hall to grab a phone, and dictate the review,” says his wife Joyce, “and I would wait for him in the car. If he wasn’t quick off the mark, a sports journalist would get the copytakers first, and we might have to wait an hour.” Kennedy has spent almost his entire adult life in Manchester, and knows the history of its musical life better than anyone. Although he’s quick to acknowledge the qualities of the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra, which has the lion’s share of the Strauss concerts, his first loyalties are with the Hallé Orchestra, whose biography he wrote more than 50 years ago. Right now he feels the orchestra is in its second golden age. \"The first came after the war. The orchestra to begin with was in a terrible state, having lost many of its players. The new manager offered the chief conductor’s job to the great John Barbirolli, who at that time was in New York. He took it on for just one year, but eventually stayed for 13. The orchestra became part of him, you could say, he just lived and breathed for it, and led some unforgettable performances.” After Barbirolli’s time, the orchestra went though good times and bad. The nadir came at the turn of the century, when the Hallé came within a whisker of going into bankruptcy. But a new chief executive, and the arrival of music director Mark Elder, turned the orchestra round. “Mark has really won the audience over,” says Kennedy, “and he really has made the orchestra one of the finest. I never thought the glory days of Barbirolli would come back again, but they have.” Barbirolli is one of the musical luminaries who helped the young Kennedy. He needed them, because he had only his native intelligence and sharp ears to guide him. Thanks to the war, Kennedy never went to university, and started work at the age of 15 at the Telegraph’s Manchester office as a tea boy. Another helping hand came from Neville Cardus, the great music and cricket correspondent. “Cardus gave me two tips about being a music critic. One was: don’t write anything you wouldn’t say to someone’s face, and the second was: never write out of a bad mood. I’ve tried to stick to those principles, and I think that’s why I’ve had so many wonderful friendships with musicians.” An even more distinguished man who placed his trust in Kennedy was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who eventually asked Kennedy to write his authorised biography. Kennedy first approached “VW”, as Kennedy calls him, in 1945, when he was serving in the Royal Navy. “I greatly admired VW and I wrote to him after the premiere of one of his pieces. Probably a rather silly letter, but I got a very nice reply, and we became friends after the war. There was a nobility about VW, a largeness of spirit, which was a wonderful thing.” At this point he and Joyce go off into a reminiscence about the other great people they’ve known together. “Michael Tippett… there was a wonderful man. He used to make us laugh by going into raptures over his own music. ‘Oh, it’s simply marvellous!’ he’d say.” More great names emerge: Janet Baker, Daniel Barenboim. Sitting in their home, with the Strauss posters on the walls, I feel the air enlarged by these mythic presences – and by Michael Kennedy himself, who thanks to his own generosity of spirit and enormous dedication to his craft has become a luminary himself.

      "Norwich novel success shows small publishers finding ways to thrive Norwich novel success shows small publishers finding ways to thrive Eimear McBride wrote her winning novel at 27 and spent many years trying to have it published Related Stories Why Eimear McBride won the Baileys prize Debut writers dominate Baileys list Debut novelist wins Goldsmiths prize Independent publishers are facing more competition than ever before, so how are they surviving in a digital world dominated by giant corporations? When author Eimear McBride won the £30,000 Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction with her debut novel, A Girl is a Half-Formed Thing, it was not only a success for her but also for the independent publisher Galley Beggar Press. The small firm, which has its headquarters in a terraced house in Norwich, was willing to take the risk when other mainstream publishers had passed. Ms McBride said: \"I couldn't be happier about the success of A Girl is a Half-formed Thing. Galley Beggar Press took a huge risk in publishing it and deserve nothing but praise for their courage, vision and good old-fashioned hard work.\" Galley Beggar Press's latest book Randall by Jonathan Gibbs is a satire on the 1990s art world Sam Jordison, co-director of Galley Beggar Press, said: \"I heard one editor (at a publishers) loved it, but somewhere along the line the marketing man did not like it.\" He said the reason they backed the novel was that \"we believed in our readers much more than other book publishers\". The novel tells of a young woman's relationship with a brother afflicted by a childhood brain tumour. \"What drew us to it is it is a fantastic work of art, it is engaging and intelligently different,\" he said. Galley Beggar Press was started in 2011 by Guardian books journalist Sam Jordison, his wife, writer Eloise Millar and Henry Layte, who runs the Book Hive bookshop in Norwich. Its remit was to \"publish titles with potential that bigger publishers have shied away from taking a risk on\". McBride's book was their second publication. They recently launched their fourth - Randall by Jonathan Gibbs - an alternate history satire set in the art world of the 1990s. “Start Quote We thought we were prepared to go bankrupt with this book (Eimear McBride's A Girl is a Half-Formed Thing)... It was almost a duty” End Quote Sam Jordison Co-director of Galley Beggar Press \"She (McBride) is a one in a million find for any publisher, that is the reason it has done so well. It is a fantastic work,\" said Mr Jordison. \"We thought we were prepared to go bankrupt with this book... It was almost a duty. It was a risk. Obviously, with hindsight, it all paid off.\" He likens the success of small publishers to micro-breweries providing the public with tastes not provided by the larger firms. \"There is very much a place for small publishers. Things are hard in the publishing industry... and it is harder for big publishers to take risks,\" he said. Bridget Shine, chief executive of the Independent Publishers Guild - which represents both small and large independent publishers - said smaller firms could give more time to \"nurturing their authors, having a more direct relationship\". Sam Jordison, co-director of Galley Beggar Press, says McBride's book was a \"one in a million find\" \"They can also move much quicker and with less bureaucracy,\" she said. She added that independent publishers were particularly successful with specialist publications and were often set up by people with specialist knowledge. John Catt Educational have increased book sales by 50% over recent years Eimear McBride's debut novel, A Girl is a Half-Formed Thing won the Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction Jonathan Barnes, editorial director of John Catt Educational - a small publisher based in Woodbridge, Suffolk - said: \"What Galley Beggar Press have achieved - uncovering a gem that everyone else has overlooked - is every small publisher's dream. \"Even then it takes a lot of hard work and perseverance to get the world to take notice: to get reviews, to get copies into bookshops and to get people talking about your book, which is ever important in the age of social media. So it's a fantastic achievement. A Girl is a Half-Formed Thing The novel tells the story of a young woman's relationship with her brother, and the long shadow cast by his childhood brain tumour. Described by the publisher as \"an unconscious railing against a life that makes little sense, and a shocking and intimate insight into the thoughts, feelings and chaotic sexuality of a vulnerable and isolated protagonist\". \"It's a very competitive market and we don't have anywhere near the production and marketing budgets of the big publishing houses. The major distributors also command significant discounts, so it's a tough environment for small independent publishers, and the industry has lost some really good companies.\" For Mr Barnes the recipe for success for small independent publishers is simple. \"What's important is that publishers have great passion for what they do and concentrate on what they're good at,\" he said.

      "The CIA and Homeland Security want to delete almost all their emails Usually, deleting emails is a no-fanfare, one-click affair -- but not when you're the Central Intelligence Agency or the Department of Homeland Security. Both agencies have recently submitted proposals to the National Archives and Records Administration that outline their plans to delete years' worth of emails, which the Archives has already tentatively approved. The CIA apparently turned one in to comply with the administration's directive, ordering federal agencies to conjure up viable plans to better manage government emails by 2016. If approved, all the correspondences of every person to ever be employed by the CIA will be flushed down the digital toilet three years after they leave. All messages older than seven years old will also be nuked, and only the digital missives of 22 top officials will be preserved -- something which several senators do want to happen. Led by California Senator Dianne Fenstein, the group sent NARA a letter detailing why they want the Archives to reconsider its tentative approval of the CIA's proposal. Based on what was written there, the senators seem concerned that the agency might use that opportunity to expunge any important correspondence or materials (say, any evidence of dubious activities) not filed as a permanent record. Homeland Security, on the other hand, says it submitted a similar proposal, because the emails it wants to get rid of don't contain any research significance and would save the government money meant for storage (which costs around $50 per terabyte a month). Its critics worry that this would delete important records of the agency's surveillance system called , among other things, which monitors government websites' traffic. Losing Einstein documentation could either mean bidding valuable data farewell or destroying evidence that it never worked as the agency intended in the first place. Funny thing is, while their plans might have been applauded by privacy advocates more than a decade ago, they're met with opposition now in light of what we've recently found out about widescale surveillance. Also, getting of rid years of correspondence from key government agencies goes against the President's promise of a more transparent and open government. As Electronic Frontier Foundation Lee Tien told , I'm concerned that destroying this data might destroy data that's material to policy questions about government action... There is a certain irony in questioning the government's reasons here, because privacy advocates normally cheer this kind of move. It's kind of sad. I want to applaud the government for choosing to discard unnecessary data about people. But we have good reason to question the government's reasons because of what we've learned about what we've NOT been told. While NARA has already tentatively approved these proposals, they're still not a done deal. They're both open for public comments, which means you can have your voice heard by via email or through its website. [Image credit: Getty Images]\n",

      "Furrier who defrauded customers Out of business Armando L. Sanchez, Chicago Tribune Former Chicago Fur Outlet proprietor Howard Bresnik, working last month out of an office at Skokie-based American Fur Mart, attempts to locate owners of furs that were left at his store after he was convicted of consumer fraud. Former Chicago Fur Outlet proprietor Howard Bresnik, working last month out of an office at Skokie-based American Fur Mart, attempts to locate owners of furs that were left at his store after he was convicted of consumer fraud. (Armando L. Sanchez, Chicago Tribune) Longtime Chicago furrier explains his business' unceremonious demise Howard Bresnik stood in a backroom of a Skokie fur store and pulled a court document out of one of the cartons stacked on a table. \"'Master Consignment —'\" he began. \"I hate to say 'victims,'\" he said. But the document did say it: Master Consignment Victim List. For 30 years, Bresnik, a genial schmoozer with a corny sense of humor, and his wife, Eve, ran the Chicago Fur Outlet (\"Home of the Furry Godmother,\" he dubbed it). For the last 27 of those years, it was at 777 W. Diversey Parkway. Divvy dogs, Swiffer babies and other Chicago ideas Barbara Brotman In honor of Chicago Ideas Week, which ended Sunday, let us celebrate a different kind of Chicago idea. In honor of Chicago Ideas Week, which ended Sunday, let us celebrate a different kind of Chicago idea. ( Barbara Brotman ) But a final consent judgment entered six weeks ago says that at the end, he committed consumer and common law fraud. He used money from some furs he sold on consignment, a portion of which he was supposed to give to their owners, to pay the store's bills. When people asked for their money or their coats back, he told them the coats hadn't sold or that he didn't know where they were. Customers lost furs valued at a total of $68,000. \"He was robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" said Cook County Assistant State's Attorney Joseph Hudson of the consumer fraud unit. It is highly unlikable conduct. But it was committed by someone I like. I was a customer of Bresnik's for years. I've found him friendly and funny — a devoted newspaper reader who calls or emails periodically with a thought or quip about a column I've written. It may be hard to quip about this one. Surrounded by the racks of furs from his now-shuttered store, Bresnik gave his explanation. His business was failing. The recession, a few warm winters and the trend toward casual dress were taking an increasing toll. And he was struggling alone. Eve, a much-loved fixture at the store, died in 2009. Some friends and family urged him to close the store, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. \"It was my store; it was my baby,\" he said. \"I always thought that we'd somehow or other come through.\" But he was running out of money. So he made his fateful decision. He intended to pay the consignors, he said. He thought if he could only hang on until the next winter season, business would pick up and he could make good. But people started complaining to the state's attorney's Consumer Fraud Unit. In April 2013, prosecutors filed suit against Bresnik and Chicago Fur Outlet. In August 2013, Bresnik closed the store. The furs he had sold on consignment were gone. But more than 700 furs were at a storage facility in Wisconsin, and Bresnik didn't have the money to retrieve them. Others were in storage locations around the area where he had sent them when he shut the store. The state's attorney's office and Bresnik, under court order to help, set about recovering the furs and returning them to their owners. Some 875 of more than 1,000 furs have been returned. Bresnik says he worked hard to get the furs back to their owners. He set himself up at a Dunkin' Donuts across the street from the closed store to watch for customers showing up to get coats out of storage. He met them and helped them arrange to get their coats from the Wisconsin storage facility, he said. \"Some people got very upset, which I don't blame them,\" Bresnik said. \"Some of them were very understanding.\" He spent hours there every day for weeks, he said, and some nights even slept there — because by then, he had no home. He had sold his Buffalo Grove home when the bank was on the verge of foreclosing on it. The state's attorney's office thinks Bresnik could have done more. While he did help locate some owners of furs, Hudson said, he didn't initially report where he had sent the furs when he closed the store. And now, when the final consent judgment requires him to spend six months continuing to try to recover and return furs, \"we have put Howard on notice, in writing, that we do not believe at this time that he is making sufficient effort,\" he said. Bresnik was also ordered to pay $68,000 in customer refunds and a $10,000 civil penalty. Hudson does not expect any of it to be collected. \"The company is defunct. He's unemployed and essentially living with his daughter in another state,\" he said. Bresnik drove back to the Chicago area recently, as he periodically does, to continue his efforts to find the owners of the remaining furs. From the storeroom at American Fur Mart, whose owners have agreed to store his furs and help in the search, he made phone calls, one of them to Gachele Coffey, whose name was attached to a pumpkin-colored shearling coat. She was glad, if stunned, to hear from him. Her daughter had contacted the state's attorney, she told him, but Coffey had not pursued the case. \"I didn't know what happened; I didn't want to file a claim against you,\" she said. \"You've always been on the up and up.\" When I called her later, she said that what Bresnik did was wrong. He had sold to someone else a cape she had bought from him but had never picked up from the store. The shearling he was returning was a replacement. But she understood his desperation. \"I know Howard never had the intention to hurt anyone,\" said Coffey, the senior producer for a Christian ministry. \"Stuff happens,\" she said. \"Sometimes ... we will get caught up in a situation and find ourselves knee-deep, and we cross the line that we will regret that we crossed.\" John Dem, who owns American Fur Mart and has known Bresnik for more than 30 years, is mystified. \"I never knew Howard this way,\" he said. \"I knew Howard as very honest, a very fair and good businessman. But I think something happened with him after his wife died.\" \"I wasn't trying to do anything underhanded,\" Bresnik said. \"I was treading water furiously, so as not to go under. I kept thinking if I keep treading water, the Coast Guard is eventually going to show up and rescue me, and it didn't happen.\" Bresnik is sorry for his customers' losses and the way it all ended. \"I feel terrible,\" he said. Those who lost coats worth as much as $2,000 probably feel pretty bad themselves. Me, I find myself trying to reconcile the wrong he did with the guy I still like. blbrotman@tribune.com Copyright © 2014, Chicago Tribune Related Content Dunkin' Brands Skokie Chicago Suburbs News Columnists Killings are grim reminder for women in sex trade The accusations against a Gary man who police say is a serial killer of women, several of whom worked for pimps or escort services, are particularly grim for the women in this room.

      "This Is The Best Obit. Ever. News Entertainment Lifestyle Tech & Innovation All Sections Sometimes, even in death, the best person to get the job done is yourself. We figure that's what led Margaret (Marge) Aitken Holcombe to write her own obituary, and when reader Pam Gallagher sent it to our attention, we had to agree that this was The Best Obit. Ever. Many thanks to The Island Funeral Home in Hilton Head Island, S.C., for its permission to publish this. Here's what Marge wrote: \"I died at Hilton Head Hospital from a wide assortment of ailments on Tuesday, August 12, 2014. When a friend facetiously asked if I was writing my obituary before or after I passed away, I told her \"Carol, I know my limitations. I was born in Paterson, N.J. to Robert Jr. and Isabella Findlay, Aitken, wonderful parents, on January 20, 1930. It was the era of \"Children should be seen and not heard\" and my sister Heather and I were thought to be deaf mutes for most of our childhood. After graduation from Paterson Central High school In January, 1948, I took a \"summer job\" with N.J. Bell Telephone Co. as a stenographer (who could not type - and never could) and ended my 35 years with them as District Manager, Residence Services. I never thought of giving up my day job to attend college because I was making the magnificent sum of $33 a week. With the help of that lavish salary and a couple of scholarships, I was relieved - make that worn out -that I did graduate in four years with a Rutgers BA in social studies with highest honors. I did this by concurrently attending Fairleigh Dickinson, Fordham and Rutgers Universities while holding down a full time job. I hope you won't think me otiose. (I always wanted to use that word.) When we retired to the Island in 1984, I volunteered for the Hilton Head Orchestra League, was President of the Port Royal Racquet Club, and served on the Hilton Head Hospital Auxiliary Board. I chaired the hospital's 1990 Charity Ball and also chaired fund-raising dinners for the hospital. As a board member of the Friends of Hilton Head Library, I initiated the ongoing Book Break series and chaired the 2000 and 2001 events. And you thought I was just another plain face, but very wrinkled. At the hospital, my volunteer job was to prepare the production reports for one department which I did for 20 years and was just getting the hang of it, when catastrophe struck. I had worked out the calculations by sliding counters along rods on my abacus. One of the important hospital staff spied this little old lady happily working her ancient tool and didn't feel that it quite projected the image that our hospital wanted - a high tech facility fast-forwarding into modern times. In short order, the abacus was gone (I think to the Smithsonian) and the reports were outsourced to India. I enjoyed my life and want to thank some of those that made this possible. Topping the list is family and close survivors, the most important, my husband Jack, was always my knight in shinning[sic] armor - well, actually my knight in tennis shorts, but for a romantic spin, I'll go with the armor. He was taken from me suddenly in April, 2014; he'll live with me forever. Surviving is my sister, Heather (Emil) Scaglione of Lavallette, N.J. She is funny, warm, overly generous and the best sister, bar none. My adored nieces are Susan (David) Helterban of Sewell, N.J.; Patricia (Robert) O'Herlihy of Ridgewood, N.J.; Roberta Tomlinson of Lavallette, N.J. I'm fortunate to have a special cousin, Dawn (Kurt) Eigenmann of Sun City and lucky, to have inherited stepson, Jon (Charlotte) of Medford, N.J. and stepdaughter Lisa Holcombe of Santa Cruz, California. Lighting up our lives were our \"adopted daughters\", Beverly Maloney and Jessica Bevan of Hilton Head. I was blessed with an angel who became my friend and caregiver, Elaine Kellmen. Carol Mueller of Hilton Head gave new meaning to the word \"friend\". She was my personal shopper for everything from greeting cards to clothes. She brought lunch every week and encouraged me to socialize, exercise and get well, generally making a pest of herself. (Kidding, Carol.) I don't know what I would have done without her and thank goodness I never had to find out. I am beholden to Burke's Main Street Pharmacy for letting me use their store as a meeting place with old friends; it was the center of my social life. David, the younger and more handsome (his words) and Tim, the older and more intelligent (his words) of the brothers Burke would ask \"Can we help you or would you just like to wander aimlessly?\" I chose the latter and came to know their stock better than they did. Our condo looked like Burke's Annex; I had everything from a simple cane to a wheelchair. When we moved, Burke's sent my prescriptions right to my door at Seabrook and their friendly delivery man's knock became the highlight of my day. We're talking mad social life here. The Seabrook was a godsend. The services they offered were perfect - I didn't have to leave the premises. The professional and helpful staff, the friendly atmosphere, makes it a special place. But the jewel of Seabrook is the food, for this \"World's Best Worst Cook\" to have the island's ultimate restaurant available each evening was beyond my wildest dreams. My waistline, if you could find it, was testament to Seabrook's cuisine. I'm thankful for the uplifting courses offered by Life Long Learning of Hilton Head Island. I joined LLHHI because just being among them made me seem more intelligent that I was - an easy task. This organization advertises that the courses, are taught by our peers - my peers they weren't - not even close. Before coming to the Island, the only thing I wrote were checks. Then the Island Packet, in 1996, asked for comments on how to unclog traffic problems on Rt. 278. I sent in a column that suggested, humorously, that the solution was for drivers to make Right Turns Only.\" Thus began a 12 year \"career\" writing a monthly humor column for the Packet. Fortunately, my editor was David Lauderdale. Not only is he a talented writer and a superb storyteller, but more importantly a good man. In case I make a return trip here, I want to cover all the bases. As a surprise for our 35th wedding anniversary, my husband published my first 84 columns in a book titled, \"May All Your Turns Be Right Ones.\" I never made left turns; it took a little longer to get places, but it cut down on the agita. The Hilton Head Rotary Club marketed the book with all proceeds going to their project of building a new home for Deep Well. Then for my 80th birthday, my spouse had the remaining columns set in a book, cleverly titled, \"May All Your Turns Always Be Right Ones.\" Again, the Rotary club sold the books with the monies designated to building a new home for Memory Matters. At a Rotary meeting we were invited to attend, Jack and I were shocked and surprised to be presented with a Paul Harris fellowship. We were honored and humbled being aware of how infrequently these fellowships are awarded to Non-Rotarians, I likened it to be second only to receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor. Thank you Hilton Head Rotary. In 2012, The Girl Scouts of America celebrated their 100th anniversary. Being a Girl Scout added so much to my life. I was honored to be a scout and absolutely thrilled to spend three summer weeks each year at Camp Te Ata in upstate New York. My husband was fascinated when I explained that one of our projects was to start a fire in the woods and heat some stew ingredients (don't ask) in a tin coffee can. It was a meal to die for, which I'm certain, some campers did. Strange, I never had one request for the \"Camp Te Ata\" stew recipe. Everyone thinks that his or her doctor is the best, but I win this contest hands down. My oncologist, Dr. Gary Thomas, who, by the way is a dead ringer for the comic actor, Jim Carrey, is a credit to his profession, and a source of strength to his patients. His staff of angels is incredible. When he called Jack and me to his office to confirm the diagnosis of multiple myeloma, my husband asked if we would see any physical changes in me. He answered, \"She'll probably grow a tail\" - Jim Carrey cold not have quipped it better. Luckily, Veronica's Secret assured me that their back-slit hostess skirt was ideally suited for my condition. What a relief. Dr. Michael Platt, my ideal primary physician for over 20 years is the kind of doctor everyone wishes they had. He is a warm, caring man who takes time with each patient; a superb diagnostician and an all-around good human being. For all these reasons, I call him \"Dr. Perfect,\" (I'm sure he's thrilled with that title). Aware of my limited mental capabilities, he scheduled extra time for my visits. Dr. P spoke slowly, drew diagrams using simple stick figures and demonstrated my problem with the full-figured skeleton to help me out. His nurse, Barbara, was always patient and kind. I couldn't have been in better hands. A big hug to Dr. Dorian Colorado and the wonderful staff at the Animal Care Clinic. When our 14 year old Cocker Spaniel, Mr. Chips, was failing, Dr. Colorado took him to her home so he would be surrounded by familiar faces and fed him bits of his favorite food. She summoned us to her clinic on a Sunday so the three of us could say our goodbyes with loving last kisses from Chips AND she delivered her first child the next morning. I told Dr. C that when my time comes to be \"put down\", she has the job. The delight of our later years is the already named Natalie-Love-Bug (don't you love it?) a friendly, huggy-kissy cocker spaniel. Because our pets give us unconditional love and enrich our lives, I would be honored to have donations made to the Hilton Head Humane Association, P.O.

      "Here’s A Hilariously Simplified Version Of The Golden Globes’ Mouth-Watering Menu Mark Davis / Getty Images Life Here’s A Hilariously Simplified Version Of The Golden Globes’ Mouth-Watering Menu A Snickers dipped in Nutella may be involved. 1/11/2015 While you’re single-handedly downing an entire bowl (or two or three) of popcorn during this Sunday’s Golden Globe Awards, the show’s audience will be nibbling on filet mignon and three different fancy-schmancy desserts. The Beverly Hilton Hotel — which has hosted the Globes for over 40 years — released a preview of their menu for the show, which traditionally involves a lot of yummy food and even yummier champagne. “I take great pride in creating this menu for the Golden Globe Awards that’s as extraordinary as the awards ceremony itself,” executive chef Troy N. Thompson said. “This year’s menu showcases the fresh, local produce that we always use here at The Beverly Hilton with exciting yet balanced flavors.” Sounds delish, right? Except you can’t go to the Globes… And you probably don’t have enough money/chef skills to reproduce the results. We understand your pain, so we put together some very easy ways to recreate the Globes’ extravagant menu. As a forewarning, these lackluster recipes probably won’t thrill your taste buds — but at least you’ll sorta be eating the same thing as Emma Stone, right? Nom nom nom.

      "Arkansas Liquor Laws: Prohibition Amendment Up for Vote Is Happening Trailer Leak In half of Arkansas's counties, liquor sales are prohibited. A constitutional amendment being voted on today would change that. Ted S. Warren—AP Voters will decide Nov. 4 whether to turn the state's dry counties wet Drop a pin on a map of Arkansas and your chances of finding a stiff drink there are about 50-50. But that could soon change if enough residents vote for a constitutional amendment on Tuesday’s ballot that would open the entire state to beer, wine and liquor sales for the first time since the 1930s. More California Voters Back $7.5 Billion Water Bond The Weirdest Moments of Election Day 2014 Breaking Bread: Can Obama and GOP Keep the Peace at Lunch? NBC News 'Pure Arctic Outbreak': Powerful Storm to Chill U.S. NBC News Brainwashed: ISIS Is Training Kids to Be Terrorists NBC News Arkansas is one of dozens of states that allow local municipalities to make their own decisions about selling booze, but only about 10 states actually have dry counties, most of which are in the South. The result is what’s known as “patchwork prohibition,” where the state is divided into wet, dry and even moist (beer and wine only) counties. Popular Among Subscribers Interstellar, Where No Movie Has Gone Before Subscribe The Last Men of Steel Review: Interstellar’s Wonder of Worlds Beyond The divisions can be confusing, with wet cities occasionally in dry counties and highly-profitable liquor stores almost always parked just across the border from booze-less regions. In Texas, for example, 49 of the state’s 254 counties are wet, 11 are dry and the rest are a combination of wet and dry. Alabama has 25 dry counties, but many cities within them are wet. And in Kentucky’s 120 counties, 39 are dry, 32 are wet and 49 are some combination of the two. No state comes closer to an equal division than Arkansas, where 37 counties are dry and 38 counties are wet. Opening these dry counties to alcohol sales has become an increasingly popular economic development tool. Several counties in Kentucky have used their “local option” to expand liquor sales in the last couple years, while voters in Alabama’s largest remaining dry city are considering a similar ballot initiative Tuesday as well (the 2012 push failed by close to 400 votes). Unlike most other votes on the wet/dry issue, the Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Initiative—which would allow the “manufacture, sale, distribution and transportation of intoxicating liquors” throughout the state beginning on July 1, 2015—is subject to a statewide vote. That’s because attorney David Couch, the chair of pro-wet group Let Arkansas Decide, found that the number of signatures required for getting the measure on the state ballot was not much more than what it would’ve taken in just the three counties he had initially targeted. Couch’s main rationale is economic. He cites a University of Arkansas study showing that if Faulkner, Craighead and Saline counties were wet—three of the state’s biggest counties, and ones where Walmart has expressed interest in selling booze —they would each generate an additional $12 million to $15 million in annual economic activity. And he estimates the total statewide benefit of going wet at an additional $100 million a year. But Couch has other motives, too. “These dry counties make my state look kind of backward, and I don’t like that,” he says. “This is a much more modern approach to alcohol regulation.” The amendment seemed to have signs of support in September. But the opposition appears to have grown in recent weeks. Part of that may be a huge cash infusion from Citizens for Local Rights, a group opposed to the amendment. The organization has raised $1.8 million compared to $200,000 for Couch’s Let Arkansas Decide. Citizens for Local Rights is backed largely by liquor retailers in wet counties that want to keep out new competition. The Conway County Liquor Association, for example, has given the group $540,000. All six counties surrounding Conway are dry. The amendment has also been criticized by religious leaders wary of making alcohol more available. Brian Richardson, chairman of Citizens for Local Rights, casts the issue as a matter of regional autonomy—no small claim in a vote that will come down partly to rural turnout. “It’s a badly written, overreaching amendment that guts local communities from being able to make decisions on a local level,” he says. “It’s letting people in the more populous counties determine this.” Couch says his only poll found majority support for passage, but it was conducted last month. Richardson says his group’s final survey points to partial prohibition remaining in place, with 58% of respondents opposed to the amendment. “I hate to jinx ourselves,” Richardson says. “But I think we’ll have a decisive victory.” Forgot Password?\n",

      "Hummingbirds Use Their Beaks To Stab Each Other, But They Have Their Reasons Hummingbirds may look cute with their colorful plumage and those long, delicate beaks. But don't be fooled: a new study shows that male hummingbirds use those sharp beaks like swords, viciously stabbing rivals in the throat to keep them away from their ladies (see video above). That makes the hummingbird the first bird known to use its bill as a weapon. What's more, the finding has ornithologists rethinking ideas about the evolution of the tiny birds. \"Historically, bird beaks have been the prime example of adaptation through natural selection, such as in the textbook example of Darwin’s finches,” lead author Dr. Alejandro Rico-Guevara, a research associate in the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, said in a written statement. “But we show here the first evidence that bills are also being shaped by sexual selection through male-male combat.” For their research, Rico-Guevara and a colleague went to Costa Rica and spent four years studying long-billed hermits, a species of tropical hummingbird native to Central and South America. The researchers measured the length and sharpness of the beaks of both young and adult birds, and observed the birds in their natural habitat. The researchers found that adult male birds had the longest, sharpest beaks and that the birds put them to use in \"jousting\" with rivals as part of a courtship ritual. And--no surprise here--the guys with the baddest beaks came out on top. The findings suggest that the male birds' beak shape evolved in response to the birds' competition for mates. Previous theories held that the birds' beaks were an adaptation that allowed them to sip nectar from flowers. But now the evidence seems to suggest that the flowers evolved in response to the birds' long beaks.\n",

      "CIA report: MPs and peers seek material on any UK 'torture' role CIA report: MPs and peers seek material on any UK 'torture' role Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Sir Malcolm Rifkind: \"If British intelligence officials were present when people were being tortured then they were complicit in that torture\" Related Stories UK defends actions over CIA report Senate report sheds light on Washington CIA report: The 20 key findings A parliamentary committee is to request the US hands over any material documenting the UK's role in the CIA's post-9/11 interrogation programme. Sir Malcolm Rifkind said the intelligence committee he chairs would act \"without fear or favour\", although some MPs want a judge-led inquiry. It follows a US Senate report which found \"brutal\" treatment of suspects. Downing Street has said some material was removed from the report at the UK's request for national security reasons. But it said no redactions related to British involvement in the mistreatment of prisoners. 'Brutal interrogations' Sir Malcolm was speaking as Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee - which he chairs - is conducting an inquiry into the treatment of detainees by British intelligence agencies in the decade following 9/11. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show it would ask the US government if it could see the redacted material. If British intelligence officials were present when people were being tortured then they were \"complicit in that torture\", he added. \"That would be quite against all the standards of this country, it would be something that ought to be brought into the public domain,\" Sir Malcolm added. Many US detainees after 9/11 were held at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba Denying accusations that the committee would water down its conclusions, Sir Malcolm said the committee would act \"without fear or favour\" and would seek answers from senior minister and former ministers, if necessary. He added: \"If people deserve to be embarrassed, it's our job to embarrass them.\" BBC political correspondent Robin Brant said it was \"almost certain\" that ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair would be called by the committee. Former Labour foreign secretaries Jack Straw and David Miliband may also be required to give evidence, he added. However, Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told the Marr Show she had concerns that the intelligence committee did not have the capacity or scope to be able to get to the truth. And Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on extraordinary rendition, called for the government to \"reconstitute a judge-led inquiry\". He said it should have \"wide-ranging powers\" and a \"substantial investigative capability\" to look into the UK's role in the CIA's interrogation programme. Clare Algar, from the charity Reprieve, told the BBC that Prime Minister David Cameron had previously said only a judge-led inquiry could get to the bottom of the UK's involvement, adding: \"I think that is still the case.\" 'Legal hurdles' A 525-page summary of the report, compiled by Democrats on the committee, was published earlier this week - although the full version remains classified. It revealed that the CIA carried out \"brutal\" interrogations of terrorism suspects in the years after the 9/11 attacks. Among the abuses, the committee found: Detainees were subjected to repeated waterboarding, slapping, stress positions and sleep deprivation One suspect was kept confined in a coffin-sized box for hours on end Others were threatened with severe harm - psychologically and physically However, the summary contains no reference to UK agencies. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper: \"We've got to have the truth\" When the report was published, Downing Street said any requests for redactions from the UK had been made by British intelligence agencies to the CIA. It said the requests had been made for reasons of national security on intelligence operations - and later added that Number 10 itself had not made any requests for redactions. A Freedom of Information request by the charity Reprieve earlier this year showed the UK government had met members of the Senate Committee on Intelligence 24 times since 2009, although there are no details about what was discussed. Meanwhile, the Sunday Telegraph reported that Defence Secretary Michael Fallon had called for former Prime Minister Tony Blair and former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw to reveal what they knew about the CIA's torture and rendition programme when they were in office. \"It's for ministers in that [former Labour] government to account for their actions,\" he said. Mr Straw told the BBC that he would \"be delighted to give evidence today\", adding that \"as soon as the legal hurdles are out of the way, I fully expect to do so\". The Metropolitan police began investigating claims that UK secret services helped in the rendition of two men to Libya in 2012, and a file was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service earlier this year.

      "When a name is all that's left: Why I changed my name after 8 years of marriage After I got married, I started getting mail addressed to Mrs. Michael Anderson. I hadn’t actually changed my last name from my maiden name, Dahlstrom, but elderly relatives and companies offering credit cards or discount oil changes seemed to assume I had. That Halloween, I contemplated dressing up as Mrs. Michael Anderson. I imagined her as my alter ego: She sounded like someone who would be an amazing cook who also enjoyed polishing silver, I thought. She’d be organized and proper. Maybe she’d wear pearls while she baked cookies that weren’t burned. In short, she was not me at all. Courtesy of the Anderson family Linda, Mike and their son Phoenix. At the time I got married, I felt that if I changed my name, I’d lose my identity. Linda Dahlstrom was the name I’d been known by my whole life and the name I’d written countless bylines under as a journalist. I didn’t want to take Mike’s name for the same reason he didn’t want to take mine — our names represent who we are. And we didn’t believe that we became different people because we were married.   We had our first child seven years later — a beautiful, sparkly, joyous little boy we named Phoenix Lind Anderson. Hyphenating our two long last names just seemed ridiculous, so we decided to give him my Swedish family’s matriarchal surname, Lind, as his middle name and Mike’s family name, Anderson, as his last name. Dixon Anderson Linda and Phoenix on Father's Day, 2005, when Phoenix was 6 months old. After he was born, we were lost in the delicious, maddening, all-consuming swirl of new babyhood. I spent hours cuddling him and drinking in his soft skin and hair and laughing with him as we blew raspberries at each other. Phoenix had mastered rolling over, much to his delight, and was on the brink of crawling when one July morning when he was 7 months and 4 days old, he woke with a fever. And then, within 12 hours, he was dead.  As the world fell away in those early days and weeks after he died of bacterial meningitis, a rare and deadly disease, I slept with his clothes. I sniffed his blankets. I greedily pressed to my cheek the silky lock of his hair the hospital had given us. I drank in any possible trace of him. I was raw and stripped down to my core — a creature operating almost purely on instinct. When a child dies, too often people stop saying his name. Some people didn’t want to bring him up for fear it would remind me of his loss. But as with most bereaved parents, there is not a moment when I’m not aware. I feel the loss in my cells, even when I sleep. Saying my son’s name to me is one of the sweetest gifts anyone can give me. Phoenix Lind Anderson. It is the music of my heart. And so, it became a name that I had a deep need to share. I wanted to claim everything I could about him. He was here. He was my son. He still is. Kathy Tucker Phoenix Lind Anderson died of bacterial meningitis, four days after this photo was taken. Phoenix's name, his mother Linda writes, \"is the music of my heart.\" About a month after Phoenix died, I stood before a judge and asked him to make Anderson my legal last name and move Dahlstrom back to become my second middle name. That afternoon I became Linda Annette Dahlstrom Anderson. In the end, I didn’t so much take my husband’s name as I did my son’s. Claiming Phoenix’s last name is my way of helping build a bridge. Whenever anyone says it, they are also saying his name again, even though most will never know it. Someday, my husband and I will be buried next to Phoenix. I need strangers who walk by and see my name on the marker to know that I belong with that little boy. I still use Linda Dahlstrom professionally. But in my home life now, I’m Linda Anderson. We have another beautiful son, Gabriel Lind Anderson, who knows that I have two names and is not confused. Sometimes I am, though — I often can’t remember which last name I’ve used for various online accounts or at the hair salon or local book store. The bank even became confounded and sent me a debit card bearing the name “Linda A. Dahlstromanderso.” (Apparently they just ran out of room.) For stories, like this, that meld personal and professional, I have no idea what byline to use. Patricia Carosso Linda with son Gabriel, now 7. But life, lived fully, is messy. I have experienced the breadth of it — the greatest joys and soul crushing despair. I live with loss but also profound happiness and gratitude. Things aren’t as simple as I thought they were when I was younger. I am a woman with two names — neither one fully or exclusively defines me. Contained within them is room for all of who I am.    Linda Annette Dahlstrom Anderson is a writer and editor at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. She lives in Seattle with her husband, Mike and her son, Gabriel, and firmly believes that women should use whatever name feels right for them.

      "VA Stops Releasing Data On Injured Vets As Total Reaches Grim Milestone [EXCLUSIVE] PFC Josh Stein, 22, a double amputee rehab patient, lost his legs to an explosion in Iraq in 2006. Getty Images PFC Josh Stein, 22, a double amputee rehab patient, lost his legs to an explosion in Iraq in 2006. Getty Previous 1 of 2 Next The United States has likely reached a grim but historic milestone in the war on terror: 1 million veterans injured from the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. But you haven't heard this reported anywhere else. Why? Because the government is no longer sharing this information with the public.  All that can be said with any certainty is that as of last December more than 900,000 service men and women had been treated at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics since returning from war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that the monthly rate of new patients to these facilities as of the end of 2012 was around 10,000. Beyond that, the picture gets murky. In March, VA abruptly stopped releasing statistics on non-fatal war casualties to the public. However, experts say that there is no reason to suspect the monthly rate of new patients has changed.  VA ceased to disclose this data despite President Obama’s second-term campaign pledge that his administration would be open and transparent. Absent information about the number of soldiers that have sought government medical help and about the types of injuries they had, policymakers, Capitol Hill and health care professionals may be hamstrung in making decisions about funding for crucial veterans' health programs and the treatments and diagnostic tools that should be researched and targeted. The reliability of future military strategies could be in jeopardy as well.   VA's actions are \"a gross injustice to veterans and the taxpaying public,\" says Anthony Hardie, a Gulf War veteran and veterans' advocate who has testified before the House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Hardie suggests that Congress should tackle the problem, perhaps even legislatively, noting that withholding the data \"reflects a VA pattern of abuse and lack of transparency.\"  Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, stopped short of making such a harsh assessment, but just barely. VA's records on veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq, he says, “were a valuable resource for the committee, and it's unfortunate that VA has decided to discontinue them for now. We have asked VA to explain what security concerns led to its decision and provide an estimate as to when it will resume production of the reports.” Miller added: “I hope VA will resolve this issue quickly, because with more than 100 outstanding requests for information from the committee currently pending, the department already has more than enough issues with transparency.\" Previously, Veterans Affairs published reports four times a year on how many patients that had served in Afghanistan’s Operation Enduring Freedom and Iraq’s Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn were seen for the first time in VA health care system. The most recent report was released in March 2013, reflecting numbers from the previous December. Nothing in June. Nothing in September. VA stopped preparing and releasing these reports on health care use and disability claims involving the 2.6 million U.S. service members who have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan without warning, claiming unspecified “security” reasons. A statement buried on an unpublicized VA web page reads, “VA and the Department of Defense are currently enhancing their existing security arrangements for the delivery of the data VA uses for these reports. At this time, it is unknown when the next reports will be released.\" [Update: hours after our story was published on Friday, the statement was updated to: \"VA and the Department of Defense have enhanced their existing security arrangements for the delivery of the data VA uses for these reports. The 2nd Quarter FY 2013 reports should be released in November 2013.\"]  Some believe privately that the enormity of the 1 million injured figure, which advocacy groups like the Veterans for Common Sense say has already been surpassed, is responsible for the reticence of VA and the Obama administration, both of whom are hoping to avoid a public relations fiasco. And several veterans advocates including Michael Zacchea, a director at the Veterans for Common Sense, suggest that there may have been some sort of data transition compromise between DoD and VA -- two agencies that have never communicated very effectively. It's even possible that VA was hacked. But no one who would know is talking. Phil Budahn, a VA spokesman, says the department was “unable to get an answer” for this story. But veterans’ advocates, lawmakers and others agree that the information VA is currently withholding is important information that Americans have a right to know. And it isn’t just a matter of acknowledging -- or refusing to acknowledge -- a shocking numerical milestone: It could also influence the treatment programs, for which funding must be quantified, and provide useful data for reducing future injuries. Zacchea sees the potential for disrupting veterans' programs as unacceptable. “VA must release information about patients and claims among our newest generation of veterans for the year 2013 so Congress makes sure VA has enough funding,” he says. Linda Bilmes, a Harvard professor and author of \"The Three Trillion Dollar War,\" who has testified before Congress about the cost of war, agrees. “We need accurate data on casualties in order to make decisions about treatment, research, operations and budget,” she says. “But we also need to know how much of our medical effort should be devoted to specific conditions such as psychiatric, pain relief, physiotherapy, substance abuse, etc. And regionally, we need to know where the demand for services is outstripping supply.” Bilmes adds that in addition to helping determine how much money the government should spend and where it should be spent, these reports help the nation study and draw conclusions from the current war effort. “Sadly, this is unlikely to be our last war,” she says. “Those of us who study the long-term effects of conflict depend on the government to collect and make available these reports that will help us to analyze what happened during this one.” Car stickers commemorating U.S. military service in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq are seen on a recruiter's table at a veterans job fair in Los Angeles.  REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson A House Veterans Affairs Committee staffer who asked not to be named because he is unauthorized to speak to the press said, however, that while the reports are important and should be shared by VA with the public, they are “not essential” for budgetary submissions. “The committee has information within VA’s budget on the number of users of the health care system broken down by era, etc.,” says the staffer. “Further, there are stats on OIF/OEF [Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom] claims activity in the budget submissions as well.” Does that mean there is enough information in these budget submissions? In 2005, Veterans Affairs officials testified before Congress that the department was doing just fine, that it had enough money. Just a few months later, then-VA Secretary James Nicholson went back to Congress, hat in hand, and asked for billions more in emergency funding to keep the department’s doors open. This was due in part to the flood of Iraq and Afghanistan patients. Zacchea, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel who fought in Iraq, says that could easily happen again. He notes that in 2007, Veterans for Common Sense sued VA, alleging the department was unprepared to handle the tidal wave of patients and claims. The case made it all the way to Supreme Court, where the court announced in January, without further comment, that it would not hear arguments in the lawsuit. It died. “We [VCS] are suspicious that VA’s reports on patients and claims ceased shortly after the Supreme Court's action early this year,” Zachea says.  Whatever the reason, VA’s reluctance to share this non-fatal war casualty information raises questions. How many patients has Veterans Affairs treated in 2013? How many more disability compensation claims does it expect to need processing? Does VA need more funding to hire doctors and nurses to treat veterans suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)? The department’s lack of transparency has generated frustration and even anger among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Congress recently held hearings on the issue of VA transparency and even created a website that keeps a running record of outstanding information requests made to the department by both Democrat and Republican members of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, commonly referred to as HVAC. “The leisurely pace with which VA is returning requests – and in some cases not returning them – is a major impediment to the basic oversight responsibilities of the committee,” the site notes. VA’s woeful track record persists despite a memo sent by President Obama to federal agencies shortly after taking office for a second term promising, “We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration.” VA is also under fire for its backlog of veterans’ disability claims. The House passed a bill this week calling for the establishment of a 15-member commission that would examine ways to expedite the painfully slow claims process. According to VA numbers, 1.4 million new, reopened and appealed claims were pending as of October 28. The average time for VA to process a claim is one year, and the department makes mistakes in 30 percent of claims. The average time for processing an appealed claim is four years. The House also passed a bill this week that would limit the amount VA can spend on executive bonuses each year, mandating a 14 percent cut to the department’s performance awards. And a House panel is examining VA spending on extravagant conferences. The Washington Post reported this week that the department held two events in Orlando near Walt Disney World that cost taxpayers at least $6.1 million, according to VA inspector general (IG). The expenses included $50,000 for a 15-minute video spoofing the Oscar-winning movie “Patton.” Five VA officials involved have resigned or retired since the IG faulted their roles the training events in Orlando, according to a newly released congressional report. But VA’s biggest and most important challenge remains caring for the onslaught of veterans returning from 12 years of war. At the end of last year, the department reported a staggering 56 percent health care usage among 1.6 million recent war veterans eligible for VA treatment.  If the same 56 percent rate is applied to the remaining 1 million service members who went to war and are expected to be discharged and become eligible for VA care in the coming years, VA may eventually treat 1.5 million Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran patients. Among these veterans, some sources revealed last year that the PTSD rate exceeds 30 percent, and one Stanford University study puts the PTSD rate at 35 percent. If accurate, that means a total of between 780,000 and 910,000 Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans may return home with PTSD, which is often debilitating. This week, legislators and several veterans’ service organizations called for VA programs to be funded one year in advance to improve planning and avoid service disruptions in any future government shutdowns. “As we saw earlier this month, in the event of a prolonged shutdown, VA would not have been able to issue disability compensation, pension payments, or education benefits,” said Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-VT, at a news conference on Wednesday. “That outcome would have been reprehensible.\" Congress currently funds only the medical care portion of VA’s discretionary budget – about 86 percent of the total – one year in advance. VA hospitals and clinics continued operating without interruption during the 16-day partial government shutdown earlier this month but other VA programs and services, including claims processing, scaled back operations. In Sanders view, the lack of casualty data could be mitigated through better collaboration between the Pentagon and Veterans Affairs, particularly by integrating electronic health records to provide real-time access to relevant military medical and personnel files. “It’s no secret that the exchange of personnel and medical records between the departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs has faced a number of challenges,” Sanders told IBTimes. On Thursday, as this article was being prepared for publication, Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs offered a telling footnote. After being contacted by IBTimes, Briggs said, Sanders' office got in touch with VA, and the department \"told us they're going to start putting up these numbers again soon. We raised the question with them, and they told that they will be forthcoming. The senator believes VA should be transparent about these numbers, and he now has assurances that they will be.” It remains to be seen whether VA will follow through with the promised release, explain why the information was withheld in the first place, and clarify whether any plans or programs have been affected by the lapse.

Remind yourself how unimportant your worries are in the big scheme of things. Making lots of decisions can burn you out. Automate as many things as you can. Watching a video of a cute animal can reduce heart rate and blood pressure in under a minute. Ladies, drink coffee. Guys, don’t. Another key element of stress is where you focus your attention. Think about benign outcomes or concentrate on the positive. According to one study, the stress management technique that worked best was deliberately planning your day so that stress is minimized. The trick to not worrying about work stuff while at home is to make specific plans to address concerns before you leave the office. The difference between a fun challenge and stressful work is often just a feeling of control. The best way to reduce job stress is to get a clear idea of what is expected of you. Stop working overtime; it’s not worth it. Art reduces stress in men. Good music can increase pain tolerance and decrease anxiety.Classical music is the most relaxing genre. Booze does reduce anxiety and punching things does make men feel better… which, frankly, explains a lot. If you have to worry, set aside a specific time during the day to do all your worrying. Before a stressful event write all your worries down. Understand the secrets to willpower, breaking bad habits, productivity, beating procrastination and achieving goals. No matter what happens, you will probably be fine. Still stressed? Here are 15 more: Talk to yourself. Lean back instead of leaning forward. Have more sex. Watch comedy. Spend more time with friends. Be compassionate. Take fish oil. Stand up straight. Meditate. Garden. Chew gum. Smell vanilla. Nap. Eat salt. Spend time in nature. This piece originally appeared on Barking Up the Wrong Tree.

      "Obama’s Afghanistan pullout may end domination of drones President Obama’s call to cut the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan to 5,000 troops in 18 months will end an era of American drone superiority over the region and jeopardize hard-fought gains against al Qaeda just as the terrorist movement’s original core is rising again, former senior defense officials and national security sources say. One U.S. official told The Washington Times that Mr. Obama’s plan has prompted frustration in the administration’s national security and intelligence circles and triggered a heated fight inside the Pentagon over what specific units will remain inside Afghanistan, as well as the extent to which they can remain at all “counterterrorism-relevant.” SEE RELATED: U.S. deploys advanced drones to Japan to watch China, North Korea The official confirmed that Mr. Obama’s decision to confine remaining U.S. forces to Kabul and Bagram Air Field, just north of the Afghan capital, by the end of 2015 will eliminate a strategic patchwork of forward operating bases used for drone missions and required for Special Forces raids such as the one that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan three years ago. A former senior U.S. military official told The Times that the closure of forward operating bases, including one in the northeastern city of Jalalabad, which deployed vital backup when a helicopter went down during the bin Laden operation, will render similar raids against remaining al Qaeda leaders such as Ayman al-Zawahiri impossible. The Obama plan risks “leading us back into the 1990s, when we were semi-blindly firing off Tomahawk missiles into empty training camps hours after bin Laden had flown the coop and hopped into a Toyota Land Cruiser,” said David Sedney, who served until last year as a deputy assistant defense secretary overseeing Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia. Enlarge Photo David Sedney, former deputy assistant defense secretary overseeing Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central ... more > With regard to drone operations, the heavy U.S. troop presence in northern Afghanistan over the past decade created the logistical capability for sustained cross-border targeting in Pakistan’s Federally Administered Tribal Areas, where more than 250 U.S. drone strikes were reported from 2005 through 2013. Although the strikes served to underpin Mr. Obama’s claims during recent years that al Qaeda’s “core” in the region was “decimated,” the administration has kept the true scope and logistical details of its drone campaign under a cloak of secrecy. Mr. Sedney said he is a “supporter of the way President Obama has used the drone program over the past five years to keep America safe.” SEE RELATED: Obama defends troubled foreign policy at West Point commencement However, Mr. Sedney and others raised questions about the extent to which the administration is abandoning what many in the intelligence community saw as one of Washington’s most effective and futuristic strategies for containing al Qaeda. Amid intense public and political outcry from Pakistan over claims that thousands of innocent civilians have been killed by American drone strikes, the Obama administration’s use of the tactic over the Federally Administered Tribal Areas has appeared to evaporate this year. Pakistani media reports suggest there have been virtually no drone strikes in the region in recent months. At the same time, Mr. Sedney said, al Qaeda “appears to be reclaiming lost ground, with its activities once again increasing in the region and its ability to exercise leadership control from Pakistan seeming to be on an upswing.” According to other sources, a portion of the debate gripping White House intelligence and national security advisers centers on whether a serious and sustainable drone campaign over the Afghan-Pakistani border region could be ramped up again as needed. General Atomics’ Grey Eagle drone, which the Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment has deployed to Afghanistan, can fly for more than 25 hours at a time at altitudes up to 29,000 feet and carry four Hellfire missiles. Such characteristics conceivably would allow for widespread drone missions inside Afghanistan, as well as cross-border missions into Pakistan, to be carried out from Bagram Air Field. The catch, according to one source who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the classified nature of the drone program, is that the Grey Eagle’s accuracy and efficiency depend on ground intelligence gathered by soldiers at forward operating bases in the region. “Technically, you can probably continue to do drone operations from Bagram, but the important question is: Where are you going to get targetable intel from?” said the source. “How are you going to know what to hit and know that it’s going to be there when your drones get there? Are you going to just have Afghans call in the targets? That’s not how we usually operate.” “The Army used to have a saying that ‘every soldier is a sensor,’” added the U.S. official, who spoke with The Times on Thursday. “Well, we’re going to have a lot fewer soldiers on the ground, and that means a lot fewer sensors.” What’s worse, Mr. Sedney said, is that once the U.S. loses the capability provided by forward operating bases in Afghanistan, that capability will be difficult to restore. “Theoretically, you could ramp it back up, but practically it’s very hard because it involves re-establishing support structures, including gaining the trust of locals to let you back in. “Politically, there will also be a great cost for it,” he said. “It’s one thing to continue an activity. It’s another thing to renew it.” Mr. Obama said Tuesday that the current U.S. force of nearly 35,000 troops in Afghanistan will be cut to roughly 9,800 by the end of this year. “By the end of 2015, we will have reduced that presence by roughly half and will have consolidated our troops in Kabul and on Bagram Air Field,” the president said. By the end of 2016, he said, the U.S. military will “draw down to a normal embassy presence” in the Afghan capital.

Read more stories The son of a former sheriff's lieutenant, Olmsted put in three decades with the department. At the end of 2006 he became captain of Men's Central Jail, where, he said, he reduced incidents of force by 25% during his tenure. He later was promoted to commander and oversaw several lockups, including Men's Central Jail. He retired in November 2010. Months later, he went to the FBI and Los Angeles Times with stories of brutality at the jail. He revealed that audits he ordered had found a pattern of aggressive behavior and inadequate supervision. A group of deputies used excessive force on inmates, he said, some to earn a place in deputy cliques. At the time of Olmsted's disclosure, the jails were under public scrutiny and Baca blamed his aides for keeping him in the dark. But Olmsted said he had shared his concerns with supervisors including Baca. All of them, he said, brushed him off. Baca's public response was direct. \"He doesn't have to ask permission to solve the problem.\" lRelated Local Outsider could end 100-year tradition by becoming L.A. County sheriff See all related 8 As a commander, Olmsted said, he didn't have the authority to remove the captain who was at the root of the problem and was told repeatedly that the jail culture could not be changed. Olmsted said his priorities were suddenly rearranged by a phone call he received in July 2010. His wife was dying of colorectal cancer. The two were separated, but he took a leave from work and cared for her at his home. She died the following month. He retired soon after. In 2012 an internal investigation was launched to determine whether Olmsted had in fact been prevented from reporting inmate abuse. He dismissed it as a witch hunt and said that nothing came of it. When Olmsted announced his candidacy for sheriff last August, Baca had yet to resign and was considered a lock for reelection. \"People think the king's the king, he can't be toppled,\" Olmsted said. \"I figured somebody's gotta give it a try.\" :: Olmsted was raised in the South Bay and graduated from Torrance High School before joining the Army. He was stationed on the border of Laos in Thailand for nearly two years, an experience that would spark an interest in learning about other countries and cultures. When he came back to the States, he got a job building and selling pool tables and bowling alley lanes. He entered the Sheriff's Department in 1978 and ran a module at Men's Central Jail. He earned a degree in business management from Cal State Dominguez Hills and a master's in public administration. For 20 years he taught criminal justice at El Camino College. Over the years he had a number of different beats, including narcotics, commercial crimes and the leadership unit. While on patrol he once helped deliver a baby, who now bears his name. cComments Bob Olmsted is the right choice, plain and simple. itstime2 at 6:40 AM June 03, 2014 Add a comment See all comments 3 When installed as captain of Men's Central Jail, Olmsted said, he spent much of his time outside the office walking around the jail. He formed a committee for employees who wanted to offer input on operations. \"He's the people's sheriff,\" said Mike Pippin, a retired lieutenant who started his career with Olmsted and now acts as his campaign advisor. \"There's no political agenda for him. If he could fix every problem in the department in four years and help groom the next sheriff, he'd leave. He's not looking for a job or to be a career politician. [He is about] 100% pure betterment of the Sheriff's Department.\" Olmsted said he wants to boost morale within the department and allow employees to have more control over promotions. But he's also made it known he intends to clean house if he gets the job. He blames the roots of the corruption on Baca and Paul Tanaka, the former undersheriff who was ultimately pressured to resign and is also running for sheriff. He's the people's sheriff. There's no political agenda for him.... [He is about] 100% pure betterment of the Sheriff's Department. - Mike Pippin, candidate Bob Olmsted's campaign advisor and former colleague \"I won't endorse anybody when I'm sheriff,\" Olmsted said. \"I want term limits. I'm not going to be traveling around the world like Baca did. That's unacceptable. Politics does come into play, but only from the standpoint of what's best for society, what's best for the citizens.\" Olmsted's detractors have wondered aloud why a self-described whistle-blower had not done more while on duty. \"You either ignored gang activity … or you were totally ineffective,\" Assistant Sheriff James Hellmold said at a March candidate debate. :: Living alone, Olmsted rents out his Huntington Beach home to his son — a minor league pitcher — and daughter-in-law. He enjoys working with his hands and refurbishing antiques. His latest find is a 1930s stage light that he hopes to repair and put in his living room. Every Sunday he watches \"60 Minutes\" because \"it makes you look at things differently.\" When he can, Olmsted goes on jogs and devours nonfiction, specifically books about leadership and changing corporate culture. His favorite author is Malcolm Gladwell, who often writes about social science research. Olmsted cited one of Gladwell's writings that compared doctors who were sued with those who weren't. Those who spent more time with patients were less likely to find themselves in court, he recalled. \"You know what he found the difference was? Fifteen minutes,\" Olmsted said. It's a lesson, he added, that cops should embrace. \"If we spent 15 more minutes with every burglary or rape victim out there, our stock would go up.\" Olmsted said he has distinguished himself from other candidates by encouraging criticism of the department. \"Every one of us is saying we're going to hold our people accountable,\" he said. \"Public, you need to hold us accountable.\" corina.knoll@latimes.com Copyright © 2014, Los Angeles Times Related Content Politics Law Enforcement Elections Lee Baca Colon Cancer Christian Orthodoxy Local Outsider could end 100-year tradition by becoming L.A.

The women's artistic team is led by European champion and double Commonwealth medallist Rebecca Downie. The men's artistic squad also includes Olympic bronze medallists Sam Oldham and Kristian Thomas, plus 18-year-old Nile Wilson. Downie is joined by Claudia Fragapane, Ruby Harrold and Hannah Whelan, who won team silver at the European Championships as well as Hannah Whelan.

      "The Best Airfare Deals for Winter 2015 The odds are in your favor this winter, as these warm-weather destinations are offering historically affordable airfare thanks to airline competition and new cultural attractions. Maui is a hot airfare deal over the cold winter. Long a place commanding four-figure airfares despite its status as a domestic destination, Hawaii is now priming for a rush of budget travelers this winter as airlines drop prices and improve comfort to remain competitive. Hawaiian Airlines upgraded their interiors to include “Extra Comfort” seats in 2014, serve complimentary hot meals in all classes, and have already run an airfare sale with deals as low as $400 roundtrip. Virgin America is due to launch flights from the west coast to both Honolulu and Maui, attracting passengers with $199 one-way promotional fares and their signature stylish service. American Airlines has already begun flying their newest Airbus A321s with brand-new interiors, on-demand entertainment, and WiFi. Joining the arms race are Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Lines, who have simply added more and more flights to Hawaii, increasing the number of seats for sale (and the potential for better deals) to the islands. The interest in Hawaii as an easy vacation destination is only projected to grow, and not just because those of the “Instagram effect” from travelers sharing experiences had as a result of the cheap deals this winter; the advance press and premiere of Disney’s new Moana movie (about a Polynesian princess) in 2016 will see a fresh surge of interest in travel to Pacific islands. Tie-in packages for family travel to Disney’s Aulani Resort on Oahu are a given. South Africa is so hot right now, both literally and figuratively. Aside from the fact that the southern summer is just beginning, Trevor Noah's appointment as the new host of The Daily Show is bringing pop culture cred to the country at the same time as the killing of Cecil the Lion in Zimbabwe is sparking interest in responsible safari tourism. Contrary to popular opinion, embarking on a once-in-a-lifetime safari is not just for the super rich and the drop in the value of the Rand means the currency exchange rate favors tourists. South Africa Airways has already been discounting airfare, with round trips from the U.S. available for as little as $600 , and more airlines are sure to follow. Check out our guide to Cape Town for extra inspiration. The northern end of South America is only increasing in affordability and accessibility. Both American Airlines and JetBlue will begin flying to Quito, Ecuador later this winter and have, over the last couple years, enhanced Colombia travel options with flights to Cartagena and Medellín. Bogotá, Colombia remains especially popular, and not just for the city's burgeoning art scene , abundance of preserved Spanish colonial architecture, and world-renowned coffee; the capital is newly home to a Four Seasons hotel and expanded flights from around the U.S. to several Colombian cities on Avianca, American, Delta, and JetBlue. With the launch of Southwest Airlines' international routes this year comes fresh, affordable options for reaching the blue waters of Belize as well as both the volcanic central region and surfer-favorite Pacific coasts of Costa Rica. These new routes--to Belize City, San Jose, and Liberia--increase competition and bring fares on rival airlines down to the \"whoa, that's incredible\" level, making a spontaneous tropical trip over the winter totally doable. There's never been a better time to make that bucketlist journey to snorkel or dive the Great Blue Hole or play in Costa Rica's bohemian surfer towns .\n",

      "Roundup: Nature versus Nurture While watching the Winter Olympics this year, you may have pondered whether top athletes are born with incredible endurance and speed or whether such skills can be developed through years of intense training. According to sports psychologist Jim Afremow, raw talent isn't everything. In The Champion's Mind: How Great Athletes Think, Train, and Thrive (Rodale Books, 2014), Afremow argues that getting an edge over the competition can boil down to mental preparation. He provides advice for how to thrive in high-pressured situations, such as avoiding comparing yourself with others and visualizing success (picture yourself at the finish line!). Although the right mental and physical preparation does help, it is also clear that success depends heavily on our genes. In The Sports Gene: Inside the Science of Extraordinary Athletic Performance (Current Hardcover, 2013), Sports Illustrated writer David Epstein combs through the scientific literature to explain the complexities of the nature versus nurture debate. “Even at the most basic level, it's always a hardware and software story,” he writes. But for some, no amount of dedicated training will do the trick. One study revealed that a chess player reached the master level after only 3,000 hours of training, whereas others had not progressed to that level after 25,000 hours. According to Malcolm Gladwell, however, we often underestimate people because “we have a definition in our heads of what an advantage is—and the definition isn't right.” In David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants (Little, Brown, 2013), Gladwell proposes that traits that seem valuable may not always work in our favor, and vice versa. He bolsters this claim with scientific research and real-life examples. For instance, he explains how a basketball team with little technical skill made the finals by playing to their one strength—defense. Although Gladwell sometimes cherry-picks data or suggests causation when none exists, he always offers a compelling way of understanding ourselves and our capabilities.
