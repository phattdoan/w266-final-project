Rare whooping crane — one of perhaps only 450 in the world — spotted near North Platte|A group of people gathered near the Golden Spike Tower on Sunday spotted a bird so rare that only about 450 exist in the world: a whooping crane. Whooping cranes tend to migrate north later than sandhill cranes. But a lone bird may end up hanging out with the sandhill cranes, as they eat and nest together, said Julie Geiser, public information officer for the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission. While Geiser said sandhill cranes usually travel in a “family group,” the groups usually see a lone whooping crane as “just another crane,” said Joel Jorgensen, nongame bird program manager for Game and Parks. Because of the whooping crane’s endangered status, Geiser and Jorgensen emphasized the importance of not harassing the bird. “If people see this bird, they will hopefully stay in their vehicle,” Jorgensen said. If you approach a bird with a camera and it starts walking away, “you should just go back to your vehicle,” Jorgensen said. “You’re not going to get a better picture anyway. It’s best to use your vehicle as a blind.” Jorgensen said whooping cranes always have to be aware of predators. He said another whooping crane has been “hanging out” near Alda since early February. Whooping cranes spotted in the area migrate from the Texas Gulf Coast to northeast Alberta, Canada, he said. Geiser said it was “cool to see that many people interested” in the bird. “When you get to see one, it’s a pretty cool sighting,” she said. “Not everyone gets to see a whooping crane.” 
Fire in Siberian shopping mall leaves at least 64 people dead|A fire at a shopping centre in the Siberian city of Kemerovo has left at least 64 people dead, many of them children, in one of the country’s deadliest blazes in nearly a decade. Russian emergency workers on Monday scrambled to reach several people still trapped in the rubble of the smouldering Winter Cherry shopping. The fire broke out on a busy Sunday afternoon and quickly engulfed the top floor of the building, spreading through a children’s ice-skating rink, play centre and a two-screen cinema. Images from the scene showed thick black smoke pouring from the roof and windows of the white-and-yellow panel shopping centre, as firefighters continued to battle the flames after nightfall from four storeys up. A Kremlin spokesman on Monday said that Vladimir Putin had been informed of the fire and “offered condolences to the relatives and loved ones of those killed.” As of Monday evening, Putin had not publicly addressed the fire, the deadliest since a club in the Siberian city of Perm burned down in 2009, killing 156. News reports on state-run television Monday said that young children at the shopping mall had called relatives from the burning shopping centre. “Tell my mother that I loved her,”one young girl told her aunt, according to the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper. “”Tell everyone that I loved them.” “We are burning,” another young woman wrote on the VK social network. “This may be goodbye.” It is still unclear what sparked the fire, which was put out on Sunday evening. Authorities on Monday said four arrests had been made in connection with the fire. The section of the shopping centre housing the cinema screens collapsed during the fire, Russia’s emergencies ministry reported on Monday. “This shopping centre on several floors was packed with people mid-day Sunday. No one knows exactly how many people there were inside when the fire broke out,” Alexandre Eremeyev, an official with the local Russian emergency services ministry, said in a statement. “Where to look for people? How many are there? That has greatly complicated the work of the firefighters,” he said, according to Reuters. Witnesses have told several Russian news agencies that fire alarms at the shopping centre did not go off despite thick smoke filling the top floor, and that the rush of people trying to escape the fire turned into a stampede. Reports later said that the emergency exits to the shopping centre were locked and a security guard had switched off the fire alarm when it activated. Investigators said they had opened several criminal investigations into the fire for negligence leading to the deaths of two or more people and for fire safety violations. The death toll on Sunday was one of the worst in a single day from a fire in Russia in the past decade. A 2009 fire in the Lame Horse disco in the Siberian city of Perm left 156 people dead, while 38 died in 2013 in a fire at a psychiatric hospital in Ramensky, a village near Moscow. 
2 West Virginia firefighters killed trying to reach fatal wreck|Authorities are trying to determine what caused a West Virginia volunteer fire department’s truck to flip and hit a rock wall while responding to an accident. Five people died in the separate accidents. Kanawha County Manager Jennifer Herrald said two firefighters from Pratt were killed and three others on the truck were injured Saturday night southeast of Charleston. The firefighters were on their way to an accident on Interstate 64-77, also known as the West Virginia Turnpike, when their truck flipped, Herrald said. The wrong-way accident the firefighters were responding to on the interstate involved three fatalities, state police spokesman Capt. Reggie Patterson said. The injured firefighters were transported to Charleston Area Medical Center’s General Hospital for treatment. Herrald said in an email Sunday the names of the surviving firefighters and their conditions, along with the names of those killed, have not been released. Kanawha County Commission president Kent Carper said in a statement it’s believed to be the worst accident involving a volunteer fire service in the county. According to the U.S. Fire Administration, an entity of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, more than 95 per cent of West Virginia fire departments are all or mostly volunteer. “It’s always hard when there’s a fatality. But when it’s someone you know and work with and see on a daily basis, it’s extremely difficult,” Shane Hudnall, a West Virginia Division of Highways safety officer, told WOWK-TV. It marked the end of an especially deadly week for firefighters nationwide. In York, Pennsylvania, two firefighters were killed and two were injured when a former piano factory collapsed Thursday. And a New York City firefighter died Friday after battling a fire at a movie set in Harlem. 
ACLU Urges Greyhound to Stop Letting Federal Agents on Board to Conduct Immigration Sweeps|Immigrant rights attorneys are urging a major bus company to stop letting federal agents on board to conduct immigration sweeps. The American Civil Liberties Union's affiliates in 10 states sent a letter Wednesday to officials for the Greyhound bus company asking them to deny agents permission to board without a warrant or on the U.S. border.The lawyers say U.S. Customs and Border Protection has been searching buses more often to check the immigration status of travelers, singling out people based on race or their appearance. Border Patrol has the power to operate immigration checkpoints and conduct other activities within 100 miles (160 kilometers) of a U.S. land or coastal border according to a federal law. But the letter says the statutes cannot override the Fourth Amendment, which protects people and businesses against illegal search and seizures. The ACLU alleges that border officials have been randomly boarding Greyhound buses to search passengers, with Greyhound's blessing. One such incident occurred in Indio last month, when a Los Angeles resident boarded a Greyhound bus, then was detained because his "shoes looked suspicious," according to the ACLU. Because his shoes looked like those of "someone who had recently crossed the border," agents questioned the man regarding his immigration status. The incident was one of many the ACLU of Southern California says it has received out of Riverside County, though the ACLU's letter to Greyhound headquarters also addressed similar reports out of Washington, Vermont, New York, Michigan, Florida and Arizona. The ACLU affiliates of New Hampshire, Maine and Texas also joined the drafting of the letter. "Greyhound is in the business of transporting its passengers safely from place to place," said Jennie Pasquarella, director of immigrants' right for the ACLU Foundations of California. "It should not be in the business of subjecting its passengers to intimidating interrogations, suspicion-less searches, warrantless arrests and the threat of deportation." According to the ACLU, the raids are being conducted by immigration agents "with the agreement of Greyhound," and the number of searches are comparable to actions of "police states." Greyhound issued a statement earlier this year saying the company was required to cooperate with law enforcement agents who demand to board the buses, but the ACLU insists agents can be denied access if they lack probable cause. Allowing immigration agents to detain passengers without probable cause is a violation of the passengers' Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful search and seizure, the ACLU argued.
Texas volunteers find severed head at lake, police say|A mother-daughter duo found human remains while they were working as volunteer cleaning up a Texas lake on Friday, authorities said. The volunteers for Texas Adaptive Aquatics made the grisly discovery while cleaning the area near Lake Houston. They discovered a severed head in a plastic bag, according to FOX26 Houston.  "[We] had 300 volunteers come out to volunteer and one of them found a gun this morning and then about 20 minutes later, someone found a head, a human head," Roger Randall, with Texas Adaptive Aquatics, told FOX26. He added, "It was a young lady, her and her mom were out helping cleanup and she was picking the trash and found a bag, a plastic bag and it was pretty heavy and she picked it up and found that it was a human head with hair.” The volunteers said they believe the head was of a young women with red hair. Homicide detectives could not confirm the age, sex or ethnicity of the individual, according to FOX26. It’s also unclear if the gun that was also found during the clean up related to the severed head. "I'm here, we'll work with medical examiner's office to identify the remains and who they belong to and then we will go with our missing persons database and go that route of missing persons in the area," said Andrew Barr, a Houston Police Department homicide detective. 
Carles Puigdemont, former Catalan president, detained in Germany|Catalonia's ex-leader Carles Puigdemont has been detained by German police acting on a European arrest warrant. Mr Puigdemont, who is wanted in Spain for sedition and rebellion, was held crossing from Denmark on the way to Belgium, his lawyer said. Mr Puigdemont will appear before a German judge on Monday. The ex-leader's supporters gathered in Barcelona to protest against his arrest. The charges he faces in Spain could result in 30 years in prison. Mr Puigdemont has been living in self-imposed exile in Belgium since Catalonia's parliament unilaterally declared independence from Spain in October. He was visiting Finland last week when the arrest warrant against him was reissued, and he slipped out of the country on Friday before Finnish authorities could arrest him. He is spending the night in a prison in the north German town of Neumuenster. His court appearance on Monday will be a formality to confirm his identity. Afterwards a decision will be made about whether he will remain in custody while the extradition order is being processed. German police said that Mr Puigdemont was detained by a highway patrol in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, which borders Denmark. After the news of his arrest broke on Sunday, thousands of demonstrators poured on to the streets of Barcelona. They chanted "Freedom for the political prisoners" and "This Europe is shameful!" as they headed to the offices of the European Commission and the German consulate. A smaller protest was held in Girona, where Mr Puigdemont once served as mayor. Tensions in Catalonia are very high and its separatist leaders abandoned plans to name a new president following the arrest of the latest candidate, Jordi Turull, on Friday. Protesters clashed with police in Barcelona on Friday night after Spain's Supreme Court ruled 25 Catalan leaders should be tried for rebellion, embezzlement or disobeying the state. Mr Turull was among five people taken into custody in fresh arrests. The rulings were considered the most serious challenge to date to the Catalan independence movement. Almost the entire leadership now faces a major legal fight. Following the referendum, the central government in Madrid sacked the Catalan regional government, imposed direct rule and called new elections but pro-independence parties returned with a slim majority. International warrants for Mr Puigdemont and other Catalan leaders were withdrawn in December by a Spanish judge, who said they had shown a willingness to return to the country. The warrants were reissued on Friday, surprising Mr Puigdemont, who had been in Finland to give a university lecture. Among those also wanted is Catalonia's former education minister, Clara Ponsati. She is in Scotland, where she has a position at the University of St Andrews, and says she is willing to hand herself in.  Carles Puigdemont, 55, is a former journalist who worked for pro-independence media in Catalonia and headed the Catalan News Agency. After moving to politics, he became an MP and later mayor of Girona, north-east of Barcelona. In 2016, he became leader of Catalonia and led the region to the referendum the following year. During his self-imposed exile following the resulting crisis, Mr Puigdemont told Belgian TV he was not hiding from "real justice" but from the "clearly politicised" Spanish legal system. 1 October 2017: The independence referendum takes place in Catalonia; it is deemed illegal by Spain and boycotted by many potential voters 27 October: Catalonia's leaders declare independence, which leads to the Spanish government imposing direct rule on the region and dissolving its parliament 30 October: Charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds are brought against various sacked members of the Catalan government, including Mr Puigdemont 2 November: Several former Catalan ministers are taken into custody in Spain 3 November: European Arrest Warrants are issued against Mr Puigdemont and four of his allies, who have all fled to Belgium 5 December: A Spanish judge withdraws the European arrest warrants but says the group still face possible charges for sedition and rebellion 21 December: Carles Puigdemont is re-elected to parliament during Catalan's regional elections - which Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy had called to "restore democracy" 1 March 2018: Mr Puigdemont says he is stepping aside and he backs detained activist Jordi Sanchez to run as Catalonia's president 21 March: Mr Sanchez drops his leadership bid and instead the candidacy is passed to Jordi Turull, who the following day is rejected by hardline separatists 23 March: Mr Turull and various others are arrested in Spain, and the European arrest warrants are reissued
Austin bombing suspect called himself a "psychopath," congressman says|The suspected Austin bomber called himself a "psychopath" in a recorded confession and said he felt no remorse for deadly explosions that killed two people and terrorized the city, a U.S. congressman said Saturday. Investigators are still looking into what motivated 23-year-old Mark Anthony Conditt, but the recording he left on his cell phone shows that he was a "sick individual," U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul said. "He did refer to himself as a psychopath. He did not show any remorse, in fact questioning himself for why he didn't feel any remorse for what he did," McCaul said. Conditt makes no mention of a racial motivation on the recording, but investigators are still looking into that as a possibility, he said. The first three victims were minorities. In the 25-minute-long cellphone confession, Conditt said "I wish I were sorry but I am not" for the deadly attacks, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News' senior investigative producer Pat Milton earlier this week. Conditt also promised he would go inside a crowded McDonald's and blow himself up if he thought authorities were closing in on him. He blamed himself for helping investigators find him by going into the FedEx store to mail explosive devices allowing him to be videotaped by store cameras and allowing them to get his license plate. He gave no information on how he chose his targets but acknowledged his actions left family members without loved ones and caused permanent injury to others. He made the audio recording around 9 p.m. Tuesday night. McCaul, a former federal prosecutor who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, spoke at a news conference where he thanked law enforcement officials for bringing the three-week spree to an end. He called the investigation, which included more than 800 officers, a textbook example of how local, state and federal agencies should work together. Beginning March 2, police say Conditt planted bombs in different parts of Austin, killing two people and severely wounding four others. He began by placing explosives in packages left overnight on doorsteps, killing 39-year-old father Anthony Stephan House and 17-year-old musician Draylen Mason and critically injuring 75-year-old Esperanza Herrera. He then rigged an explosive to a tripwire along a public trail, injuring two young men who crossed it. Finally, he sent two parcels with bombs via FedEx, one of which exploded and injured a worker at a distribution center near San Antonio. Conditt died after detonating a explosive device early Wednesday as SWAT team officers ran toward his vehicle to arrest him in an Austin suburb. Investigators discovered a roughly 25-minute recording that Conditt had made on his cell phone allegedly confessing to the crimes. Interim Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said the department will continue withholding the recording from the public as investigators look into Conditt's motive and whether anyone else was involved. He noted that Conditt's two roommates have been questioned and said that several more people will be interviewed. Releasing the recording now could jeopardize any future prosecutions, although no one else has been arrested or charged, Manley said. For days, Manley has been under fire for calling Conditt "a challenged young man" and not a terrorist. He struck a different note Saturday, saying: "The suspect in this incident reined terror on our community for almost 3 weeks." Austin Mayor Steve Adler said Herrera, who suffered broken legs and other severe injuries in a March 12 blast, remains hospitalized in critical but stable condition. Herrera's grandson, Josh, wrote on his Facebook page that she has undergone several surgeries and is fighting for her life. The identification of Conditt as the bomber continued to baffle residents in Pflugerville, the Austin suburb where Conditt had been home-schooled and grew up in a Christian family. Mark Roessler, 57, lives across the street from where Conditt moved in last year, a mile from his parents. Conditt and his father had purchased the home in a quiet neighborhood known as Old Town, and spent months remodeling it together. Roessler said he got to know Conditt's father, Pat, during the project and said he was "kind of envious" of the time he got to spend working with his son. He said Mark Conditt was "polite, very quiet and respectful." Roessler said he last saw him some time after the first bomb had exploded, but didn't talk with him. He said he never had any idea his neighbor was allegedly using supplies such as batteries and nails to assemble bombs in his home. "People died and it's a horrible tragedy. My feelings move from shock and disbelief to going to the 'what-ifs'," he said. "What if I tried to reach out to him that last time I saw him? 'Hey Mark, how are you doing?'"
Mark Zuckerberg’s Net Worth Has Dropped $10 Billion in the Last Week|Mark Zuckerberg isn’t exactly waiting around for his tax return, but it’s been a rough financial week for the Facebook chief exec nonetheless. The CEO’s net worth has dropped more than $10 billion in the last week as Facebook stock has fallen 14 percent in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data leak. Shares of the social network continued their week-long slide on Friday, slumping 3.3 percent to $159.45 per share. That’s down from $185.09 at the close-of-bell last Friday, before the scandal broke about 50 million users having their information unwittingly accessed. As Facebook has lost $60 billion in market cap, Zuckerberg has went from “extremely wealthy” to “slightly less extremely wealthy,” with his  have lost $10.1 billion in value in the past week. The 33-year-old exec, who holds roughly 393.1 million shares of company stock, is now worth “only” $62.7 billion — dropping him from fifth to seventh place on Forbes’ billionaire rankings. You can send your cash donations to 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, if you’re inclined. Facebook has faced mounting criticism over the data leak, both from users and advertisers. The #DeleteFacebook hashtag gained steam this week on Twitter, with WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton and Tesla chief exec Elon Musk joining in. At the same time, advertisers have started to question their relationship with the second biggest ad business on the internet. Facebook opened 2018 trading at about $180 a share, and pushed to its all-time high of $195 a share in early February. Investors will get a look at whether a major segment of users are ditching the platform when Facebook reports its quarterly earnings later this spring. 
SFO terminal to be renamed in honor of Harvey Milk|San Francisco is preparing to rename a terminal at the San Francisco International Airport after slain LGBT supervisor Harvey Milk and install artwork memorializing the civil rights icon. The name change was first introduced in 2013 by then-Supervisor David Campos, who had initially hoped to name the entire airport after Milk, the first openly gay elected official in a major city, but the proposal met with opposition. Instead, an airport naming committee was established, which recently recommended naming SFO’s Terminal 1 after Milk, who was elected to the Board of Supervisors in 1977. He served in the post until he was gunned down at City Hall in 1978 along with Mayor George Moscone by former Supervisor Dan White. Nearly five years later, the Board of Supervisors Budget and Finance Committee is set to vote Thursday on legislation introduced by Supervisor Hillary Ronen and co-sponsored by Supervisor Jeff Sheehy calling on the airport to make the change. The legislation requires the director of the airport to report to the Board of Supervisors and the Mayor by Dec. 1 “describing the steps the Airport has taken and plans to take” to name the terminal after Milk and publicize it. Ronen said she also plans to amend the legislation to require the director to submit to the Arts Commission a plan for placement of artwork memorializing Milk in the terminal by September or October. “In order to honor one of the nation’s great gay leaders, raise awareness of the history of the LGBT movement, and give hope to young LGBT people in cities everywhere, the Board of Supervisors finds it fitting that a terminal at the San Francisco International Airport be named in honor of Harvey Milk,” the legislation says. “It’s a long time coming. It’s the gateway to San Francisco, and so recognizing Harvey and making that connection to our community is appropriate. It’s beautiful,” said Sheehy during an editorial meeting with the San Francisco Examiner on Monday. Ronen said she would have preferred naming the entire airport after Milk, as initially conceived, but said there are strong opinions “all over the country when you try and rename an airport” and San Francisco proved no different. “I know that’s what people were fighting for,” Sheehy said. “The amount of effort that it would have taken to do that when we have a lot of things we need to work on in the community — it would have been fun to have it named after Harvey but what we have now is a good compromise.” The estimated cost to the airport to implement the name change is $357,000, according to a Budget Analyst report, which includes $22,000 to replace existing signage, such as AirTrain Station identification signs, directories, and maps of the Airport and terminals, and $335,000 to place a new building sign on Terminal 1. The funding is expected to come from the existing signage budget as part of the terminal’s $2.4 billion renovation, which began in 2016 and is expected to continue in stages until 2024. Ronen said given the rise in murders of LGBT people in the country and the current political climate with President Donald Trump, the gesture is more than just symbolic. She said it will help combat hate and bring “material change in people’s lives” when they may arrive and see “there’s a place where they belong.” The 688,000 square foot Terminal 1 sees 32,200 passengers daily from fliers on airlines Frontier, Southwest, American and Delta during peak travel months. “We will follow the direction of the Board of Supervisors legislation if passed, and incorporate this into the design and construction of Terminal 1, which opens in phases starting mid-2019,” SFO spokesman Doug Yakel said Wednesday. The Los Angeles International Airport has a terminal named after Los Angeles’ 38th and only Black mayor, Tom Bradley, who died in 1998. If approved by the committee, the full board would vote on the legislation on April 3. Mayor Mark Farrell is in support of the terminal renaming and is open to other naming honors there. “I fully support the renaming of San Francisco International Airport Terminal 1 to honor Harvey Milk, just as I did while serving as Supervisor,” Farrell said. “And if there is public support to consider other renamings for notable San Franciscans like the late Mayor Ed Lee or Senator Feinstein, then I want the Airport Commission to re-engage its committee process.” 
UN reports see a lonelier planet with fewer plants, animals|Earth is losing plants, animals and clean water at a dramatic rate, according to four new United Nations scientific reports that provide the most comprehensive and localized look at the state of biodiversity. Scientists meeting in Colombia issued four regional reports Friday on how well animal and plants are doing in the Americas; Europe and Central Asia; Africa; and the Asia-Pacific area. Their conclusion after three years of study : Nowhere is doing well. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem was about more than just critters, said study team chairman Robert Watson. It is about keeping Earth livable for humans, because we rely on biodiversity for food, clean water and public health, the prominent British and U.S. scientist said. "This is undermining well-being across the planet, threatening us long-term on food and water," Watson said in an interview. Scientists pointed to this week's death of the last male northern white rhino in Africa, severe declines in the numbers of elephants, tigers and pangolins, but said those are only the most visible and charismatic of species that are in trouble. What's happening is a side effect of the world getting wealthier and more crowded with people, Watson said. Humans need more food, more clean water, more energy and more land. And the way society has tried to achieve that has cut down on biodiversity, he said. Crucial habitat has been cut apart, alien species have invaded places, chemicals have hurt plants and animals, wetlands and mangroves that clean up pollution are disappearing, and the world's waters are overfished, he said. Man-made climate change is getting worse, and global warming will soon hurt biodiversity as much as all the other problems combined, Watson said. "We keep making choices to borrow from the future to live well today," said Jake Rice, Canada's chief government scientist for fisheries and oceans, who co-chaired the Americas report. Duke University conservationist Stuart Pimm, who wasn't part of the study team, said the reports make sense and are based on well-established scientific data: "Are things pretty dire? Yes." Among the regional findings: THE AMERICAS If current trends continue, by the year 2050 the Americas will have 15 percent fewer plants and animals than now. That means there will be 40 percent fewer plants and animals in the Americas than in the early 1700s. Nearly a quarter of the species that were fully measured are now threatened, Rice said. And when all of "nature's contributions" are taken into account, nearly two-thirds are declining and more than one-fifth are "decreasing strongly," Rice said. ASIA-PACIFIC If trends continue, there will be no "exploitable fish stocks" for commercial fishing by 2048. Around that same, the region will lose 45 percent of its biodiversity and about 90 percent of its crucial corals, if nothing changes, said Asia co-chair Sonali Seneratna Sellamuttu, a senior researcher at the International Water Management Institute. "All major ecosystems are threatened in the region," she said. EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA Even though it is the region that Watson said may be doing the best, 28 percent of the species that only live in Europe are now threatened. In the last decade, 42 percent of the land plant and animal species have declined, said Europe co-chair Mark Rounsevell of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. Wetlands have been cut in half since 1970. AFRICA Africa could lose half of some bird and mammal species by 2100. And more than 60 percent of the continent's people depend on natural resources for their livelihoods, said report co-chair Luthando Dziba of South African National Parks. Already more than 20 percent of Africa's species are threatened, endangered or extinct. While scientists said government and society needs to change its ways, individuals can use less energy, less water and eat less red meat, Watson said. "A balanced diet can really help," he said. There are "lots of individual things you can do." The outlook is bleak if society doesn't change, but it still can, Watson said. "Some species are threatened with extinctions. Others, just pure numbers will go down," Watson said. "It will be a lonelier place relative to our natural world. It's a moral issue. Do we humans have a right to make them go extinct."
