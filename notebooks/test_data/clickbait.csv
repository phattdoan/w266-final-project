I downloaded 14 years of my Facebook data and here's what happened|After downloading my stored data on the site — I've been a member since 2004 — I was presented with an enormous amount of personal details that have been collected about me over the years. It had the phone number of my late grandmother who never had a Facebook account, or even an email address. It preserved the conversations I had with an ex-- someone with whom I thought I had deleted my digital ties. It even recalled times I was "poked," a feature I had forgotten about. I also learned that Kate Spade New York and MetLife have me on their advertiser lists. Staring at the data was not only creepy but it drudged up painful memories. After the news broke last week that data firm Cambridge Analytica accessed information from 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge, I wanted to know more about what information Facebook has on me. By visiting the Settings page, I clicked an option to download a copy of my data at the bottom of the general account section. Facebook emailed me a link to download my data. The process took about 10 minutes. (The downloading time depends on how much data you've generated.) The data is segmented into groups: like ads, contact info, events, messages, timeline, and more. I started with the ads tab and learned which advertisers possessed my contact information. They included Bed, Bath and Beyond, Target, and Marriott Rewards ... and a few crowdfunding sites I had never heard of. One of my male colleagues had a few surprising advertisers collecting his data: Rod Stewart, Sally Beauty and Cyndi Lauper. (He said he's not a fan of any of those brands. I can view the dates I became friends with among my contacts on Facebook. Facebook also preserved conversations I had with people I've tried to forget. But apparently I didn't try hard enough. That includes the guy I dated on and off for several years. I hadn't actively deleted our Messenger conversations. (Messenger is the chat app also owned by Facebook). I needed to delete the history of our conversations in order to erase it from Facebook's digital memory ... and mine if I ever want to look back at my data and not see those conversations. Simply "Unfriending" wasn't enough. The "contact info" section read like a Rolodex of all the contacts I've had ever stored in my phone -- including individuals that I no longer have in my most recent iPhone. It wasn't immediately clear how I could purge this data from Facebook's memory. The company has not yet responded to a request for comment. How to control other data was more straightforward -- like manually revoking the Facebook app's permissions that I once authorized to access my Facebook information. Same goes for advertisers. To take myself off customer lists for certain -- or all -- advertisers, I simply needed to "uncheck" them via the Preferences page. The key is understanding all of the information that Facebook is gathering. In all this, I came to the realization that the act of Facebooking should not be a passive sport.
This is what Bill Gates would tell his teenage self|As the richest man in the world, Bill Gates is no stranger to success. So when the billionaire tech mogul and philanthropist offers insight or advice, it's smart to listen. On Monday, the Microsoft founder and co-chair of The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation hosted an "AMA," or "ask me anything,"session on Reddit, during which a participant inquired, "If you could give 19-year-old Bill Gates some advice, what would it be?" Here's what Gates had to say: "I would explain that smartness is not single dimensional and not quite as important as I thought it was back then. I would say you might explore the developing world before you get into your forties. I wasn't very good socially back then, but I am not sure there is advice that would fix that — maybe I had to be awkward and just grow up..." In short: Intelligence isn't one-dimensional — and it's not the only ingredient required for success. This isn't the only time Gates has doled out advice for navigating your years as a young adult. One of his best nuggets of wisdom comes from fellow billionaire and friend, Warren Buffett: Keep things simple. In a 2009 interview with CNBC, Gates said: "You look at his calendar, it's pretty simple. You talk to him about a case where he thinks a business is attractive, and he knows a few basic numbers and facts about it. And [if] it gets less complicated, he feels like then it's something he'll choose to invest in. "He picks the things that he's got a model of, a model that really is predictive and that's going to continue to work over a long-term period. And so his ability to boil things down, to just work on the things that really count, to think through the basics — it's so amazing that he can do that. It's a special form of genius."
RedShark News - This could be the best way to get top software without destroying your bank account!|As videographers, many of you have probably already forked out rather large sums of money for equipment. Be it hardware such as cameras and lighting, or software for post-production, your wallets are probably looking a little thin. Not only that, but if you haven't already, you're likely to soon realise that there's going to be a whole bunch more stuff you're going to need when it comes to sound creation and editing. You're likely to need to purchase sound effects and music, you've got foley to consider as well as field recordings and then it'll all need to be edited and mixed! However, fear not as I have a solution that won't leave your bank account hollow. The second hand market! As the world moves forward and technology becomes more advanced, so do the ways in which we utilise it. For years, companies have been desperately pouring money into fighting piracy and file sharing, mostly in vein. However, in more recent times we're seeing an embrace of the concept of second hand software and fairer pricing for all. Gone are the days that only high-end studios could afford such lavish equipment. Nowadays, many commercial releases are being recorded and edited in facilities that equate to no more than home studios. So how does second hand software work? In a phrase, license transfers. Many big names in the audio world have begun to embrace the idea that users should have the ability to sell on their software when they are done with it. Much like many of you have done before with a car or a house, you probably won't want the same thing forever and your needs will change. As an example, Ableton now allows users to sell their software on the second hand market and then transfer the serial and license to the new owner. For you videographers, being able to pick up Ableton second hand for a one time price of as little as £30 on eBay is going to be a wondrous thing. Especially for those of you who are now having to pay £20/month for Adobe CC and perhaps only treat this is a hobby. I know I would struggle to find the money for an additional £20-30/month. Not only does this license transfer concept apply to some DAW distributors but it can also be found in the plugin world. Native Instruments allow their software to be sold second hand as well as Soundtoys and some Izotope plugins. I'm certain the list goes on. Now, of course there are plenty of free plugins out there to be taken advantage of. In fact, some of them are pretty good at what they do. However, you're unlikely to ever parallel the quality and diversity that a purchased plugin will give you. Taking the time to have a hunt around on eBay and audio forums could potentially save you hundreds. Money better spent on important things, such as catering! Another interesting and related topic that I will briefly touch on here as well is subscription services. Much like Adobe CC, a lot of audio software can now be purchased via rent-to-own or a simple subscription service. Splice is a fantastic sample/plugin library company that offers a token system whereby you can download high quality samples for a small fee each month. Often, we're looking for a very specific sound effect to fit a scene which usually leads to the purchase of a sample pack containing thousands of sounds for around £50. That's wasted money, not to mention hours downloading thousands of files we don't even need. Splice takes all of this wasted time and money out of the equation and lets us find the exact sound we want and grab it. Quick, effortless, and best of all, whatever you download you get to keep forever. Even if you cancel your subscription, those files are yours! A final discretionary word to the wise. Be careful. Despite the concept of second hand software taking leaps forward, there are still people out there looking to profiteer from your misjudgement. Any company that offers license transfers will have a clear statement on it within their website. Do your homework and make sure that what you're looking to buy is indeed available in this manor. Despite it's reputation, eBay is a far safer platform these days and with the added protection of PayPal, you will be covered if everything goes wrong!The second hand software market is booming. It continues to grow and it allows those of you with less budget to still be able to compete in the commercial market. License transfers are becoming more and more available, allowing you to grab software second hand. Also, because it's software, you don't have to consider the usual worries of wear and tear when you buy a second hand item. It'll be brand new! Check out subscription services for music and sound effects to save yourself time and money. Be careful when buying second hand software and make sure you protect yourself with something like PayPal buyer protection. Now get out there and start improving your sound!
Tiny Mummy’s ‘Alien’ Appearance Finally Explained|Ata is just six inches tall, with a conical-shaped head and unusually hard bones for her size. Some have claimed that she’s an alien. But a new study published today in the journal Genome Research not only continues to disprove the alien theory, but also reveals a scientific explanation for her allegedly extraterrestrial appearance. The debate started in 2003 when the naturally mummified remains of Ata were discovered near a ghost town in Chile’s Atacama Desert. A Spanish businessman, Ramón Navia-Osorio, purchased her mummy and in 2012 allowed a doctor named Steven Greer to use x-ray and computed tomography (CT) imaging to analyze her skeleton. Greer is the founder of The Disclosure Project, which is “working to fully disclose the facts about UFOs, extraterrestrial intelligence, and classified advanced energy and propulsion systems,” according to its Web site. Ata is only as long as a human fetus. But a radiologist who analyzed the images said that Ata’s bones were about as mature as those of a human six-year-old. Were Chile's death-cult mummies inspired by desert conditions? At the time, Greer also provided samples of Ata’s bone marrow to immunologist Garry Nolan at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif. Nolan’s team sequenced Ata’s DNA and concluded that her genetic material was from a human being, not an alien. But he couldn’t explain how such a small person could exhibit her unusual physical appearance. “Once we understood that it was human, the next step was to understand how something could come to look like this,” Nolan says. So Nolan worked with genetic researchers at Stanford and with computational biologist Atul Butte’s team at the University of California, San Francisco to analyze Ata’s genome. According to their new study, mutations are present in seven of Ata’s genes that are all involved in human growth. Nolan now thinks that this combination of mutations caused Ata’s severe skeletal abnormalities, including her unusually rapid bone growth. He says that Ata is most likely a human fetus who was either stillborn or died soon after birth. But those who believe that Ata is extraterrestrial aren’t changing their minds, regardless of the new scientific revelations. These mummies show how cultures the world over have found ways to preserve the dead in almost any environment. “We don’t know what it is, but it most certainly is not a deformed human,” says Greer, who is aware of the new research. Scientists, however, say that in light of the new analysis, it’s time to bury the Ata controversy. “The alien hype was silly pseudoscience promoted for media attention,” says paleoanthropologist and anatomist William Jungers, an emeritus professor at Stony Brook University Medical Center. “This paper puts that nonsense and poor little Ata to bed.” Doctors who treat children with rare genetic bone disorders also think the debate highlights how archaeologists and other scientists can be misled by genetic disorders that cause unusual physical features. For instance, geneticist Fowzan Alkuraya points to the controversy surrounding the “hobbits,” small creatures that were discovered 15 years ago in Indonesia. Scientists are still embroiled in debate over whether the diminutive beings are relatives of modern humans, or are simply humans with unusually small size. “This paper serves as a reminder about the exotic nature of many genetic disorders,” says Alkuraya, who is a geneticist at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. All humans—Ata included—can have many different genetic mutations. But usually only one of these mutations actually causes a child’s disease. It’s “virtually unheard of” for seven mutations to be involved, Alkuraya says; he thinks that one or at most two of the mutations probably caused Ata’s growth problems. How to make a mummy in 70 days or less. Nolan disagrees: “That poor child unfortunately rolled the dice seven times snake eyes,” he says. But it would be difficult, if not impossible, to decide which of Ata’s genetic defects caused her symptoms. That’s because scientists don’t have any information about Ata’s relatives. If they had DNA from Ata’s parents, for instance, they could check which of Ata’s mutations were also present in her mother and father. Any of Ata’s mutations that were also present in her parents’ DNA might be harmless, because unlike Ata, her parents lived long enough to conceive a baby. Even though no one knows anything about her parents, Nolan thinks that someone cared for Ata when she died about 40 years ago. He points to the way she was carefully laid flat on the ground, wrapped in a leather pouch. “They didn’t just throw it away; somebody thought it was important. It was their child,” Nolan says. Like Jungers, Nolan now wants to see Ata returned to Chile and laid to rest once again. “I don’t think that people should be trafficking in human bodies and claiming they’re aliens for the sake of monetary advantage,” Nolan says.
A student was suspended after staying in class and not walking out.|An Ohio high school student has found himself at the center of political controversy after an online post about his suspension for staying in class during the national student school walkout went viral. But that story isn’t exactly true. Jacob Shoemaker, a senior at Hilliard Davidson High School in Hilliard, Ohio, was in fact suspended. But not because he chose not to join his classmates and the hundreds of thousands of students across the country who walked out of their classrooms to protest gun violence in the wake of a Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead. It was because he didn’t go to a designated area of the school where the non-protesters were supposed to be, and instead stayed by himself in a classroom. He stayed in the classroom, his father said, because he didn’t want to choose a side. “He was uncomfortable going to either location as he thought that going outside would most likely be politicizing a horrific event which he wanted no part of,” his father, Scott Shoemaker, wrote in a Facebook post on Friday. “But staying inside would make him look disrespectful or insensitive to 17 innocent victims if it turned out to be more of a memorial service.” On social media, however, Shoemaker’s now-viral suspension slip has been spun into a tale about how a liberal school system impeded the rights of a student who supported the Second Amendment, and misleading headlines painted a picture of Shoemaker being suspended solely on the grounds that he did not participate in the walkout.This comes at a time when the push for greater gun control has gained momentum, with the Florida shooting survivors set to lead a gun-control march on Washington on March 24. The response to these efforts have at times fallen along partisan lines. On Twitter, users shared Shoemaker’s photos of the suspension slip with hashtags such as #GunControlNever and #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder. One person tweeted, “To paraphrase George Orwell, some speech is more equal than others.”To paraphrase George Orwell, some speech is more equal than others: "Ohio Student Suspended for Refusing to Leave Classroom During Gun Control Walkout" https://t.co/spherJ4HTg — Kelly Johnston (@johnston_kelly) March 16, 2018 Shoemaker’s father said he has been inundated with so many supportive messages and threats from strangers who saw the viral posts that he is considering changing his number, he told the Independent in Massillon, Ohio. One of Shoemaker’s father’s old phone numbers, as well as the numbers of school district officials, have been circulating on social media. One Twitter user singled out Hilliard Davidson Principal Aaron Cookson for being a “#BadEducator” and “#BadDad.” Shame on @adcut2, principal of Hilliard HS for using taxpayer staff and resources to support a political protest and for suspending student Jacob Shoemaker for not participating. #BadEducator #PoorExample #BadDad— flapjacker99 (@flapjacker99) March 16, 2018 Ohio student suspended for staying in class during walkouts https://t.co/hzddMYl8eg the Left is vicious in its indoctrination of our hapless students who don’t stand a chance if they’re conservative or non-radical. gun violence isn’t the only threat to our classrooms. #marxists — Jimmy Constantin (@JimConstantin27) March 16, 2018 Cultural Marxism! Ohio student SUSPENDED for staying in class during National Walkout Day. Are you kidding me! So the conservative practicing his freedom of speech and supporting the 2nd Amendment gets suspended? This teacher should be deported! https://t.co/bWnvIxY7DU — Deplorable4NRA (@JudeDeplora) March 16, 2018 The walkouts taking place at thousands of schools across the nation were viewed by some as politically divisive. Lawmakers such as New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) joined students in walking out of their classrooms and called for stricter gun legislation, chanting with students, “Gun control now.” NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch, on the other hand, told Fox News’s “Fox & Friends” that students were unjustly blaming the NRA and President Trump for the Florida school shooting instead of promoting safer schools. While the walkouts were for the most part peaceful, some conservatives pointed at a violent protest at Antioch High School in Nashville, where a group of students ripped the flag down from its pole and stomped on it, according to a video posted by Fox17. Police said students also jumped onto a patrol car, according to WZTV. On the night before his school’s walkout, Shoemaker told his father that he wasn’t sure about participating in the walkout, and that school officials were, in some respects, pressuring the students to pick a side. “The biggest problem, Dad, is that there shouldn’t be politics in the classroom … I may just sit in my seat. As far as I’m concerned, that’s the least intrusive of the choices I’ve been given,” he told his father, according to the Independent. Shoemaker added that he wasn’t the only student who felt this way. School district officials said that “well under” half of the student population participated in the walkout — but that the majority of students were “comfortable and confident” in their decision not to participate. [ N.Y. governor says schools should drop any punishment given to kids who joined gun violence protests ] On Wednesday, Jacob Shoemaker stayed sitting in his classroom, by himself, for about an hour. A scribbled note on the suspension slip he was handed read: “Student refused to follow instructions after being warned repeatedly by several administrators. Student not permitted on property 24 hours.” “He stayed in the classroom, where he was supposed to be in the first place,” Shoemaker’s father told the Independent. “It’s kind of ironic.” Shoemaker and his father could not be immediately reached by The Post. While school officials could not confirm whether Shoemaker was suspended for privacy reasons, Hilliard district spokeswoman Stacie Raterman confirmed to the Independent that the suspension slip in the photos circulating online was real. A statement on the district’s website Friday said the walkout was not designed to be political and was not carried out that way. It was instead meant to memorialize the victims of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Students had the option not to participate, but had to be supervised, as the walkout took place during school hours, district officials said. “We do not leave students unattended in classrooms. This is the same practice our district implements when students opt out of other school programs or activities. We provide an alternative, supervised location,” district officials said. “There is inaccurate and false information being circulated regarding both the intent of these gatherings and the events that took place during a specific activity at Davidson High School,” district officials said. “These gatherings were not political events; they were respectful gatherings remembering the senseless loss of young people.” 
A Woman Calls 911 To Order Pizza—For The Most BRILLIANT Reason!!|Barbara is a passionate writer and animal lover who has been professionally blogging for over 10 years and counting. One in four women will experience domestic violence[1] during their lifetime, and that’s what makes this story so incredible. A former police dispatcher recently posted an amazing story about a domestic violence call that took a surprising turn. The story has since gone viral — and for very good reason! At first, the dispatcher thought a call from a woman wanting to “order pizza” was just a prank, like any dispatcher would. But it was far from a phony phone call; it was a cry for help, disguised in the most brilliant way. The dispatcher typed out the entire exchange that he had with the caller: Dispatcher: 911, where is your emergency? Caller: 123 Main St. Dispatcher: Ok, what’s going on there? Caller: I’d like to order a pizza for delivery. (oh great, another prank call). Dispatcher: Ma’am, you’ve reached 911 Caller: Yeah, I know. Can I have a large with half pepperoni, half mushroom and peppers? Dispatcher: Ummm…. I’m sorry, you know you’ve called 911 right? Caller: Yeah, do you know how long it will be? Dispatcher: Ok, Ma’am, is everything ok over there? do you have an emergency? Caller: Yes, I do. Dispatcher: And you can’t talk about it because there’s someone in the room with you? (moment of realization) Caller: Yes, that’s correct. Do you know how long it will be? Dispatcher: I have an officer about a mile from your location. Are there any weapons in your house? Caller: Nope. Dispatcher: Can you stay on the phone with me? Caller: Nope. See you soon, thanks. After they hung up, an officer arrived at the woman’s home and her boyfriend was arrested for domestic violence. He was drunk, and physically abusing her. I just thank God Keith stayed on the phone with her, and didn’t hang up. It was fate that this woman got him as a 911 dispatcher — who stayed alert during the call, and kept an open mind. What a BRILLIANT, quick-thinking woman.
Ant McPartlin Made Emotional Confession To Mum After Crash|Fans have grown increasingly worried about beloved TV personality Ant McPartlin after his return to rehab. The 42-year-old presenter was arrested on suspicion of drink driving following a collision which resulted in a young child was taken to hospital. Ant will appear before magistrates next month on charges of drink-driving, with his long-time co-host Dec Donnelly presenting the final two episodes of Saturday Night Takeaway solo. After failing a roadside breathalyser test, police officers took Ant away for questioning. A witness told The Sun how the 42-year-old presenter appeared to be ‘agitated and argumentative.’ Ant’s mum Christine Woodhall had been in the car with him at the time of the crash, which took place at a roundabout in Mortlake, south west London. A source told the Mirror how Ant had a tearful heart-to-heart with Christine after being questioned by officers. According to the source, Ant admitted to being ‘burnt out:’ Ant spoke to his mum soon after. He was in a complete state. It was a very emotional conversation.  This latest incident comes after a traumatic time for the presenter, who has publicly spoken about his battle with alcohol and prescription drugs addiction. After spending time in rehab, Ant returned to work in November for his annual appearance on Im a Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! The pair even joked about Ant’s rumoured absence from the show. In January 2018, Ant split from his wife, make-up artist Lisa Armstrong after being married for 11 years. Pressure was reportedly put on the marriage due to Ant’s addiction issues. While accepted the duo’s 17th TV presenter prize at the National Television Awards, Ant spoke with emotion about the issues he had been experiencing: I had a very tough summer last summer, I had to face up to a lot of things and my one thing was just getting back to work with my best mate.An emotional Ant reportedly told Christine, ‘I’ve really messed up this time.’ This latest incident comes after a traumatic time for the presenter, who has publicly spoken about his battle with alcohol and prescription drugs addiction.

Ant’s publicist Simon Jones made the following statement in the aftermath of the arrest: Ant has decided to go back into treatment and step down from his current TV commitments. He has spoken with Dec and ITV today and asked for time off for the foreseeable future. As such ‘Saturday Night Takeaway’ will not be going ahead this Saturday. As someone who has grown up with Ant and Dec’s work, I’m sure I speak for many people when I say how heartbreaking it is to see the likeable presenter struggling in this way. Heres hoping he will receive the support he needs to get himself back on track, ready to become the fun uncle we know him to be for Dec’s unborn baby.
5 Reasons To NOT Vaccinate Your Kids|People shouldn’t have to vaccinate their kids. In fact, parents absolutely know what’s best for their kids in every situation, which is why you’ve never heard of a mom calling a doctor at two AM because her child has a fever. Moms automatically know exactly what to do. They know better than anyone what their child needs or doesn’t need. When a woman conceives a child, the entirety of human knowledge is written into her essence and as that child is brought forth unto this world, that knowledge flowers in her mommy brain and every decision she makes for her child is absolutely the right, and only right decision. That’s why the vaccination debate is so ridiculous to me…because moms inherently know more than everyone. Stay updated: Follow Science Doesn’t Care What You Believe on Twitter as @SciDoesntCare So here are 5 Reasons To NOT Vaccinate Your Kids. 1. You don’t like them, anyway. I get it. Some kids are just born a little more awful than others. So if your plan is to not vaccinate your kid in hopes that they’ll catch some horrible virus that’ll off them so you can start over, sure. That makes total sense. It’s evil, and disgusting, and I hope you get a million fire ant bites, but hey, the good news is that’s less likely to happen to you than your child catching something deadly because you’re an inherent dumb-dumb. 2. You’re more scared of big scientific sounding words than you are of viruses that have killed millions upon millions of people. I get it! Vaccines have a lot of big, scary words. And, some of the ingredients in vaccines have been linked to carcinogenic risks and I bet even a very eensy teensy tiny portion of the population might be allergic to some of the ingredients and they might have a bad reaction. Know what? That’s why the doctor keeps you at the office for 15 minutes after your child receives a vaccine. That way if they react, the doctor can fix it. Nifty set up, huh? And as for the scary words, know what other scientific word kills people? Dihydrogen monoxide. And yet you still put it into your body every single day. So put away your dictionary, and stop freaking out over words that you maybe don’t understand. 3. You believe all internet memes are true. “Gandhi was against vaccines. A mother flipping meme told me so.” Yeah, I’ve seen that meme. And I’ve looked it up. And you know what he compared vaccines to? Eating beef. Vaccines are as bad as eating beef because cows and all life is sacred. So here’s where that comes from: the small pox vaccine was derived from cows infected with cow pox. Which means that every person who received a small pox vaccine was being given a small amount of cow. I can definitely understand why a man whose religion holds cows as sacred would be against being injected with one. But unless you, too, are a fruitarian (which he was), perhaps you should put down your Big Mac and go get your kids their freakin’ vaccines. 4. You’d rather your children build their immunity to things like polio and measles naturally…just like you did. Oh, wait. You didn’t have polio did you. Know why? ‘CAUSE YOUR PARENTS GOT YOU VACCINATED! 5. You know more about vaccines from that one article you read online than your pediatrician knows after eight years of higher education and thousands of hours of study. I’ll just let the people in this video address that one… Look, I understand that I don’t live in your house, I’ve not experienced your life and I certainly can’t judge you for your parenting choices. But I’m going to anyway. Not getting your children vaccinated is really stupid. Like, it’s really stupid. It makes me furious and makes the blood in my veins boil with hatred toward you for putting your children in such a vulnerable and dangerous position. And if it just affected YOUR children, I might even be able to hold back my vitriol; but, it doesn’t. Your infected child can infect a child who is too young to be vaccinated. Your child can infect a child who is fighting cancer, or whose immunity has been compromised by something else entirely out of their control. YOUR child can act as a walking time bomb and spread illnesses that haven’t been around for years all because the idea of giving them a medically sound shot scares you. Your child deserves better. Get your kids vaccinated. Don’t be that parent that we all hate.  
Former Trump aide says president 'may have done something illegal'|In a pair of extraordinary interviews on Monday, former Donald Trump aide Sam Nunberg said he would defy a grand jury subpoena from special counsel Robert Mueller but also said the president “may have done something” illegal. Speaking first to the Washington Post and then on MSNBC, Nunberg vowed to defy Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 US election and alleged collusion between Trump aides and Moscow. Mueller has indicted 13 Russians and four former Trump aides, three of whom have entered plea deals involving cooperation. Nunberg, however, said he would tear up his subpoena live on Bloomberg TV. He also told MSNBC host Katy Tur, the author of a bestselling book on the Trump campaign, that he thought the candidate “may have done something” illegal during the election. He added: “I don’t know that for sure.” Later, Nunberg told the Associated Press that though he was angry over Mueller’s request to have him appear in front of a grand jury and turn over thousands of emails and other communications with other ex-officials, he was “going to end up cooperating with them”. A protege of veteran political operative Roger Stone, Nunberg was Trump’s political adviser before the start of his White House run. He was fired in August 2015, over racially charged Facebook posts, after he and Stone lost an internal power struggle with the then campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Nunberg was sued by Trump on the eve of the 2016 Republican convention, for allegedly leaking information about Lewandowski’s relationship with the close Trump aide and future White House communications director Hope Hicks. The case was settled and Nunberg has remained close to many in Trump’s orbit. Speaking to the Post, Nunberg dared Mueller to act if he refused to appear before a grand jury on Friday. “Let him arrest me,” he said. Speaking to MSNBC, Nunberg said: “I think it would be funny if they arrested me.” Nunberg told Tur he would not cooperate with Mueller, saying: “It’s a witch-hunt and I’m not going to cooperate. “Why do I have to spend 80 hours going over my email? That I’ve had with Steve Bannon and Roger Stone? Why does Bob Mueller need to see my emails when I send Roger and Steve clips and we talk about how much we hate people?” Nunberg also said that had Trump not won the Republican primary, “he was probably going to endorse Hillary Clinton”. He also showed the Post a copy of what appeared to be his subpoena, the newspaper reported, which included a list of names of those about whom the special counsel is seeking information. Hicks, former White House strategist Steve Bannon, Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, Lewandowski and Stone were among the names listed. Speaking to the AP, Nunberg retreated again, saying: “I’m happy if the scope changes and if they send me a subpoena that doesn’t include [ex-foreign policy adviser] Carter Page.” Nunberg insisted he had never spoken to Page, a key figure in the Russia investigations, and said the only reason he was being asked to testify was to provide information to be used against Stone, which he would not do. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, dismissed Nunberg’s comments. “I’m not going to weigh into someone who doesn’t work at the White House,” she said. “From our perspective, we’re going to cooperate with the special counsel’s office and the reason we’re so comfortable doing so is there was absolutely no collusion with the Trump campaign.” Nunberg also asked Tur for advice, saying: “What do you think Mueller is going to do to me?” Tur responded: “I’m not a lawyer, I don’t know but given the circumstances you might be held in contempt of court.” In a separate television interview, Nunberg told CNN that Mueller “thinks Trump is the Manchurian Candidate” though the former aide said he disagrees. Nunberg said he believes investigators are interested in learning more about the Miss Universe pageant Trump held in Moscow in 2013. ‘Call it chaos’: Trump adrift after week of White House anarchy “They probably want to know about Miss Universe 2013, if I had to guess,” Nunberg said. “There was nothing there, but they want to hear the testimony. They want to hear what other people id, and perhaps other people told them different things than I heard.” It was during this visit to Moscow that Trump is said to have discussed potential business opportunities in Russian. Nunberg said he was asked about Trump Tower Moscow, which was under discussion but never built. Investigators also asked him about the goings on inside Trump Tower in New York, where Trump lived and worked before moving into the White House. “They asked questions to me in terms of did I hear Russian spoken around Trump Tower? No, Gloria, I never heard Russian spoken around Trump Tower, OK? Now, I understand why they have to ask that, but it was pretty ridiculous to me,” Nunberg said, referring to CNN’s political analyst, Gloria Borger. 
Melania Trump: Plan to Divorce Donald Revealed?!|The world doesn't quite know what to make of Melania Trump. Is she a victim or an enabler? Is she complicit in her husband's misconduct, or is she just as appalled by the allegations against him as everyone else. Hell, the public is so conflicted on the subject of Melania that there are those who question if she even exists. e don't claim to have all the answers, but our best guess is that she's a real human woman who probably doesn't relish the task of being forced to publicly defend one of the world's most hated men. Melania has mostly managed to dodge questions about her husband's policy positions, but she's likely finding it a little more difficult to avoid speculation about his alleged infidelity. As you've no doubt heard, there have been several reports of the president cheating on his wife in recent months. In addition to the accusations leveled by Fire and Fury author Michael Wolff, there have been several scandalous revelations about Trump's relationship with Stormy Daniels, And all of this comes on the heels of a campaign that was marred by allegations of sexual misconduct, including charges prompted by the now-infamous Billy Bush tapes.
